## cable-next-js-build

### Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before
Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file. We recommend every repository include a readme, license, and .gitignore.

### …or create a new repository on the command line

```
echo "# cable-next-js-build" >> readme.md
git init
git add readme.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M master
git remote add origin git@github.com:ttiimmothy/cable-next-js.git
git push -u origin master
```

### …or push an existing repository from the command line

```
git remote add origin git@github.com:ttiimmothy/cable-next-js.git
git branch -M master
git push -u origin master
```

```
-m stands for modifications with inline messages
-M stands for manage
-u stands for upstream
```

### …or import code from another repository
You can initialize this repository with code from a Subversion, Mercurial, or TFS project.
