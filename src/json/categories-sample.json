        "content": "Across the globe, there are many cultural differences that define each country. As a traveler, it’s important to educate yourself on what you should and shouldn’t do when visiting a new locale.\n\nAnd since food is such a big part of travel, it’s important to learn the dining etiquette of each nation. It differs greatly from place to place. For example, in many areas of China it’s considered a compliment to [burp after a meal](https://www.buzzfeed.com/adamellis/surprising-food-etiquette-rules-from-around-the-world) ― a sign that you’ve eaten well ― while stateside, that same act will get you some serious side eye.\n\nOne easy way you can commit a faux pas while eating abroad is with your plate ― should you wipe it clean or leave some food? It all depends on where you are.\n\nHere are four nations where what you do with your plate matters. Study up before you make another big trip.\n\n## India \n\nIn India, you [should finish everything](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/international-food-customs-8-weird-food-etiquette-trends-from-around-the-world-thrillist-nation) that is on your plate because it is [considered a respect for the served food](http://www.culturewavesglobal.com/india-etiquette-), and food in India is considered sacred. In South India, where food can be served on a banana leaf, it is polite to fold your leaf over from the top ― not from the bottom, because [that indicates you were not satisfied](http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2007-10-17/etiquette-101-india).\n\n## Japan\n\nThe same is true about finishing your plate in Japan. The Japanese consider it [rude to leave food on your plate](http://www.japan-talk.com/jt/new/in-Japan-you-need-to-finish-your-plate), whether at home or at a restaurant. It’s related to one of the fundamental concepts in Japanese culture, [mottainai](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/avoiding-waste-with-the-japanese-concept-of-'mottainai'/6722720), which is a feeling of regret at having wasted something.\n\n## China\n\nIn China, however, leaving behind an empty plate is a [sign to the host that you’re still hungry](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/international-food-customs-8-weird-food-etiquette-trends-from-around-the-world-thrillist-nation). If you don’t want to eat more food, consider leaving a little behind to let the host know [you have had enough](http://www.healthytravelblog.com/2012/08/10/travel-etiquette-part-3-eating-without-embarrassing-yourself/).\n\n\n## Ethiopia\n\nEthiopians don’t even bother with plates. Individual plates [are considered wasteful](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/asia/travel-tips-and-articles/76513?lpaffil=lp-affiliates). Folks share meals off of [one big communal plate](http://www.foodbycountry.com/Algeria-to-France/Ethiopia.html), and generally eat with their hands using injera ― a type of flat bread ― to pick up the food. So, don’t even think about asking for your own plate.\n",

                "content": "> There is no love sincerer than the love of food \nsaid George Bernard Shaw, and let us also add that there's arguably no better way to explore a culture than to eat voraciously while traveling. Yes, there are many five-star restaurants worth booking an entire trip for, but it's equally important to savor classic treats from across the world.\n\n## Paella in Valencia, Spain\n\n![5b9eeba22100003000c61e59_9098d9fb0a.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba22100003000c61e59_9098d9fb0a_176b2163c1.jpeg)\n\nIt’s this classic rice-based dish that first pops to mind when thinking of Spanish gastronomy. For the best there is, head to the source: Valencia. And don’t forget to scrape the bottom of the pan for heavenly bites of crunchy rice, or socarrat: the most flavorful arroz ever to land on your palate.\n\n## Nasi Lemak in Malaysia\n\n![5b9eeba22400005100542e38_cf4839f0ad.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba22400005100542e38_cf4839f0ad_84f89b8451.jpeg)\n\nMalaysia’s national dish, nasi lemak is a fragrant coconut-milk rice mixture, served with sambal sauce, fried crispy anchovies, toasted peanuts, and cucumber and cooked with screw pine (pandan) leaves. Available on almost every street corner, this much-loved classic hits all the notes.\n\n## Pintxos in San Sebastián, Spain\n\n![5b9eeba82200005600da3822_01759bd55b.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba82200005600da3822_01759bd55b_b46108e1aa.jpeg)\n\nAmong the most highly ranked cities for Michelin-starred restaurants, San Sebastián boasts pintxos (the equivalent of small tapas) with über-creative takes on classics and beyond. Spain’s haute cuisine shines in this culinary paradise on the Basque coast.\n\n## Pastel de Nata in Lisbon\n\n![5b9eeba53c00005b000abbf4_be4ab6d075.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba53c00005b000abbf4_be4ab6d075_e909882796.jpeg)\n\nThe most iconic Portuguese pastry, the [pastel de nata](http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20111107-a-bit-of-history-in-every-sweet-bite) is a sublime custard tart with hints of lemon, cinnamon, and vanilla. Buttery goodness in the middle, crunchy sweetness on top—what’s not to love?\n\n## Mole in Puebla, Mexico\n\n![5b9eeba62100003100c61e5b_d99dbc2910.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba62100003100c61e5b_d99dbc2910_75979ebd04.jpeg)\n\nMole, a specialty in the Mexican city of Puebla, is a labor of love. The spicy-sweet combination of this rich, chocolate-colored sauce takes arduous preparation and packs ingredients such as ancho chiles, spices like anise and coriander, sesame seeds, almonds, peanuts, stale bread, brown sugar, raisins, chocolate, and ripe plantains. The culminating dish is fit for the gods.\n\n## Sichuan Hot Pot in China\n\n![5b9eeba32500003500370d46_7d51fc80cd.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba32500003500370d46_7d51fc80cd_783924b96a.jpeg)\n\nThis isn’t for the faint of heart. But if you’re an extreme spice lover, you’ll welcome the tears that come from the hot pot’s perfect nexus of pain and pleasure.\n\n## Tagine in Morocco\n\n![5b9eeba93c000032000abbf6_12bb2e5346.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba93c000032000abbf6_12bb2e5346_9e0dac4fca.jpeg)\n\nThis slow-cooked savory stew, typically made with sliced meat, poultry, or fish and lots of herbs and spices, is true Moroccan soul food. Cooked for hours in a clay cooking pot with a conical lid (known as a tagine), this irresistible dish is served with couscous or bread and can be found all over Morocco.\n\n",

No, the world's first hamburger comes from China.\n\n## Wait what?\n\nIf you're scratching your head right now, you're not alone. But Chinese hamburgers are very real and they definitely predate the [hamburgers we call our own](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-16-essential-regional_b_5682151) in the U.S. Known as rou jia mo, which translates to \"meat burger\" or \"meat sandwich,\" they consist of chopped meat inside a pita-like bun, and they've been around since the Qin dynasty, from about 221 BC to 207 BC. Despite the differences between this Chinese street food and our American-style [burgers](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/perfect-way-to-eat-burger_n_4704188), the rou jia mo \"[has been called the world's first hamburger](http://www.marcussamuelsson.com/news/street-food-rou-jia-mo-from-china)\".\n\nThe rou jia mo originated in the Shaanxi Province of China, and is now eaten all over the country. It's typically prepared and eaten on the street. The dough for the bun, or mo, consists of a simple mixture of wheat flour, water and maybe yeast. Of course recipes may vary, but this basic equation makes for a chewy and subtle pillow for the delicious filling. While the mo is [traditionally baked in a clay oven](https://www.starchefs.com/cook/savory/technique/rou-jia-mo-chinese-hamburger), today it's often fried in a pan. They may look a little like [Chinese steamed buns or baos](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bao-facts_n_5000963), but the dough for those are, of course, steamed, not baked or fried.\n\n![https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f59304_eda97f6eaaad4c96a80de0d235813138~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_360,h_240,al_c,q_90/f59304_eda97f6eaaad4c96a80de0d235813138~mv2.webp](/uploads/f59304_eda97f6eaaad4c96a80de0d235813138_mv2_128aac85a3.webp)\n\n\nThe meat filling might consist of chopped pork, beef, lamb or chicken that has been stewed with a variety of spices, like ginger, cloves, coriander and star anise. You might also find herbs like cilantro or greens like lettuce garnishing the sandwich.\n\nIf you've never had a Chinese hamburger, now is as great a time as any to try one.

                "content": "Thanks to [Ferran Adrià](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-measure-the-restau_b_5475536), tapas and a fascination with all things pork -- from chorizo to chicharrones -- Spanish cuisine has been a star in the food world in recent years. But a less familiar part of Spanish cuisine is Basque -- considerably unique and different from the broader Spanish cuisine that has been exported across the globe. Basque cuisine is worth getting to know, however, and with an influx of Basque-inspired restaurants in food-forward cities like New York, it appears that this culinary tradition is gaining the foothold it deserves.\n\nBasque country lies in the North of Spain near the Bay of Biscay and in South Western France. With fertile ground for grains and vineyards in an area called Álava, and good land for livestock breeding in Vizcaya and Guipúzcoa, Basque country has a rich culinary heritage. It's no wonder then that today the region boasts [almost 40 Michelin starred restaurants](http://www.euskoguide.com/food-drink-basque-country/michelin-star-restaurants.html).\n\nI spoke to executive chef and owner of the new Basque-inspired restaurant [Huertas](http://huertasnyc.com/t) in New York City to learn more about the unique cuisine. Ten years ago, after working in some of New York's most prominent restaurants, chef Jonah Miller took off for Northern Spain to learn more. In April of this year he opened his first restaurant, dedicated to the food he studied and fell in love with.\n\n**I asked Jonah to describe some quintessential Basque dishes, and the overarching themes were salt cod and peppers.**\n\n*Salt Cod (in many forms), including:*\n- Kokotxas al Pil-Pil - Fish cheeks and throats in a \"pil-pil\" sauce, which refers to the sound made when shaking a cazuela to activate the natural gelatin in the fish cheeks.\n- Tortilla de Bacalao - A salt cod omelet.\n- Porrusalda - Potato, leek, salt cod soup.\nPiperrada - Sauteed peppers (they use lots of peppers), onions, garlic and tomato, often served with a fried egg.\nStuffed Piquillo Peppers.\nMarmitako - Tuna with potato and pepper stew.\n\n**I also asked what some quintessential Basque beverages might be.**\n\n> Sidra (cider), which is much dryer and funkier than ciders we are familiar with, and Txakoli, slightly effervescent white wine. Both are low in alcohol and highly acidic -- perfect to drink with pintxos.\n\n**So what are pintxos?**\n\n> \"Pintxos are small, composed bites that unlike tapas, aren't meant to be shared,\" explained Miller. Fans of tapas but not always down to share every bite, we like the sound of pintxos. Basque restaurants are best known for pintxos, and at his restaurant, Miller naturally serves a variety. Among his favorites are:\n*Gildas - White anchovy, olive and pickled pepper skewer (named after 1946 Rita Hayworth role).\nSoft Boiled Quail Egg with Black Anchovy and Piquillo Peppers.\nFried Eggplant with Honey and Goat Cheese (local eggplant just started).\nWood-Fired Chorizo with Pickled Carrots.*\n\n![https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/07/c8/a9/55.jpg](/uploads/55_3a3cb7ffba.jpg)\n\n**Other than Pintxos, what are more distinguishing features of Basque cuisine that you won't find anywhere else?**\n\n> Lots of salt cod. As far back at the 15th century Basques were the best ship builders in Europe and dominated the whaling trade. When the whaling trade dried up, they began going further into the north Atlantic to fish for cod, which they salted aboard the ship as a means of preservation and then brought home. So even though cod is not present in the waters around Spain, it is the fish most commonly used in the Basque country (though almost always dried). They use more Foie Gras than other areas of Spain.\n\n**Miller serves a lot of egg dishes at Huertas, so I wondered too how important eggs were in Basque cuisine.**\n\n> [In the Basque country] they enjoy eggs at all times of day throughout Spain... Eggs are often the canvas for beautiful seafood, produce or charcuterie, such as wild mushrooms, local asparagus, jamon...\n\n**I asked what brought him to Northern Spain in the first place and what drew him to the cuisine.**\n\n> Ten years ago when I was growing up working in kitchens, Spain was at the forefront of influencing modern cooking techniques. So that was largely what attracted me to studying abroad in Madrid (as well as honing my Spanish speaking, which is helpful in NYC kitchens), as well as not knowing much about Spanish cuisine and looking forward to learning something new. When in Spain, I came to appreciate not the modern cooking, but how great the old-school pintxo and tapas bars were, how fun they were to dine in and felt that we didn't have much representation for that experience in New York. Being a native New Yorker, I think we should have the best of everything available here, and wanted to bring more great Spanish food to our city.\n\nThe food and culture of the north of Spain translates better than the south of Spain to New York. For one thing, being closer to the rest of Europe, the north is more cosmopolitan and a bit more diverse. Also, the climate in the north (and accordingly produce) is not far off from that of New York.\n\n**Now I'm hungry. I asked what a typical way to start and end a Basque meal is.**\n\n> [To start,] Txakolina and simply cooked seafood. [To finish,] there are some delicious Basque vermouths, which are a bit sweet and are had after dinner or often in the afternoon (some of which we offer, as well as making our own). They do make caramels and toffees, as well as Turron, an almond nougat. All traditional ends to a meal. There are also many cakes and tarts that are traditional.\n\n**So now that I'm ready to dive head first into Basque cuisine, what would be an approachable dish to try making at home?**\n\n> Pintxos!! Go to Despana (a Spanish specialty foods store), pick up one or two cheeses, one or two cured meats, anchovies, a tin of seafood; the greenmarket for some seasonal produce and local honey; get some good bread, toothpicks, and start trying out different combinations. Try this cheese with honey and shaved carrots, those anchovies with tomato on toast.\n",

        "content": "> There is no love sincerer than the love of food \nsaid George Bernard Shaw, and let us also add that there's arguably no better way to explore a culture than to eat voraciously while traveling. Yes, there are many five-star restaurants worth booking an entire trip for, but it's equally important to savor classic treats from across the world.\n\n## Paella in Valencia, Spain\n\n![5b9eeba22100003000c61e59_9098d9fb0a.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba22100003000c61e59_9098d9fb0a_176b2163c1.jpeg)\n\nIt’s this classic rice-based dish that first pops to mind when thinking of Spanish gastronomy. For the best there is, head to the source: Valencia. And don’t forget to scrape the bottom of the pan for heavenly bites of crunchy rice, or socarrat: the most flavorful arroz ever to land on your palate.\n\n## Nasi Lemak in Malaysia\n\n![5b9eeba22400005100542e38_cf4839f0ad.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba22400005100542e38_cf4839f0ad_84f89b8451.jpeg)\n\nMalaysia’s national dish, nasi lemak is a fragrant coconut-milk rice mixture, served with sambal sauce, fried crispy anchovies, toasted peanuts, and cucumber and cooked with screw pine (pandan) leaves. Available on almost every street corner, this much-loved classic hits all the notes.\n\n## Pintxos in San Sebastián, Spain\n\n![5b9eeba82200005600da3822_01759bd55b.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba82200005600da3822_01759bd55b_b46108e1aa.jpeg)\n\nAmong the most highly ranked cities for Michelin-starred restaurants, San Sebastián boasts pintxos (the equivalent of small tapas) with über-creative takes on classics and beyond. Spain’s haute cuisine shines in this culinary paradise on the Basque coast.\n\n## Pastel de Nata in Lisbon\n\n![5b9eeba53c00005b000abbf4_be4ab6d075.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba53c00005b000abbf4_be4ab6d075_e909882796.jpeg)\n\nThe most iconic Portuguese pastry, the [pastel de nata](http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20111107-a-bit-of-history-in-every-sweet-bite) is a sublime custard tart with hints of lemon, cinnamon, and vanilla. Buttery goodness in the middle, crunchy sweetness on top—what’s not to love?\n\n## Mole in Puebla, Mexico\n\n![5b9eeba62100003100c61e5b_d99dbc2910.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba62100003100c61e5b_d99dbc2910_75979ebd04.jpeg)\n\nMole, a specialty in the Mexican city of Puebla, is a labor of love. The spicy-sweet combination of this rich, chocolate-colored sauce takes arduous preparation and packs ingredients such as ancho chiles, spices like anise and coriander, sesame seeds, almonds, peanuts, stale bread, brown sugar, raisins, chocolate, and ripe plantains. The culminating dish is fit for the gods.\n\n## Sichuan Hot Pot in China\n\n![5b9eeba32500003500370d46_7d51fc80cd.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba32500003500370d46_7d51fc80cd_783924b96a.jpeg)\n\nThis isn’t for the faint of heart. But if you’re an extreme spice lover, you’ll welcome the tears that come from the hot pot’s perfect nexus of pain and pleasure.\n\n## Tagine in Morocco\n\n![5b9eeba93c000032000abbf6_12bb2e5346.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba93c000032000abbf6_12bb2e5346_9e0dac4fca.jpeg)\n\nThis slow-cooked savory stew, typically made with sliced meat, poultry, or fish and lots of herbs and spices, is true Moroccan soul food. Cooked for hours in a clay cooking pot with a conical lid (known as a tagine), this irresistible dish is served with couscous or bread and can be found all over Morocco.\n\n",

                "content": "Across the globe, there are many cultural differences that define each country. As a traveler, it’s important to educate yourself on what you should and shouldn’t do when visiting a new locale.\n\nAnd since food is such a big part of travel, it’s important to learn the dining etiquette of each nation. It differs greatly from place to place. For example, in many areas of China it’s considered a compliment to [burp after a meal](https://www.buzzfeed.com/adamellis/surprising-food-etiquette-rules-from-around-the-world) ― a sign that you’ve eaten well ― while stateside, that same act will get you some serious side eye.\n\nOne easy way you can commit a faux pas while eating abroad is with your plate ― should you wipe it clean or leave some food? It all depends on where you are.\n\nHere are four nations where what you do with your plate matters. Study up before you make another big trip.\n\n## India \n\nIn India, you [should finish everything](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/international-food-customs-8-weird-food-etiquette-trends-from-around-the-world-thrillist-nation) that is on your plate because it is [considered a respect for the served food](http://www.culturewavesglobal.com/india-etiquette-), and food in India is considered sacred. In South India, where food can be served on a banana leaf, it is polite to fold your leaf over from the top ― not from the bottom, because [that indicates you were not satisfied](http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2007-10-17/etiquette-101-india).\n\n## Japan\n\nThe same is true about finishing your plate in Japan. The Japanese consider it [rude to leave food on your plate](http://www.japan-talk.com/jt/new/in-Japan-you-need-to-finish-your-plate), whether at home or at a restaurant. It’s related to one of the fundamental concepts in Japanese culture, [mottainai](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/avoiding-waste-with-the-japanese-concept-of-'mottainai'/6722720), which is a feeling of regret at having wasted something.\n\n## China\n\nIn China, however, leaving behind an empty plate is a [sign to the host that you’re still hungry](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/international-food-customs-8-weird-food-etiquette-trends-from-around-the-world-thrillist-nation). If you don’t want to eat more food, consider leaving a little behind to let the host know [you have had enough](http://www.healthytravelblog.com/2012/08/10/travel-etiquette-part-3-eating-without-embarrassing-yourself/).\n\n\n## Ethiopia\n\nEthiopians don’t even bother with plates. Individual plates [are considered wasteful](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/asia/travel-tips-and-articles/76513?lpaffil=lp-affiliates). Folks share meals off of [one big communal plate](http://www.foodbycountry.com/Algeria-to-France/Ethiopia.html), and generally eat with their hands using injera ― a type of flat bread ― to pick up the food. So, don’t even think about asking for your own plate.\n",

                "content": "Thanks to [Ferran Adrià](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-measure-the-restau_b_5475536), tapas and a fascination with all things pork -- from chorizo to chicharrones -- Spanish cuisine has been a star in the food world in recent years. But a less familiar part of Spanish cuisine is Basque -- considerably unique and different from the broader Spanish cuisine that has been exported across the globe. Basque cuisine is worth getting to know, however, and with an influx of Basque-inspired restaurants in food-forward cities like New York, it appears that this culinary tradition is gaining the foothold it deserves.\n\nBasque country lies in the North of Spain near the Bay of Biscay and in South Western France. With fertile ground for grains and vineyards in an area called Álava, and good land for livestock breeding in Vizcaya and Guipúzcoa, Basque country has a rich culinary heritage. It's no wonder then that today the region boasts [almost 40 Michelin starred restaurants](http://www.euskoguide.com/food-drink-basque-country/michelin-star-restaurants.html).\n\nI spoke to executive chef and owner of the new Basque-inspired restaurant [Huertas](http://huertasnyc.com/t) in New York City to learn more about the unique cuisine. Ten years ago, after working in some of New York's most prominent restaurants, chef Jonah Miller took off for Northern Spain to learn more. In April of this year he opened his first restaurant, dedicated to the food he studied and fell in love with.\n\n**I asked Jonah to describe some quintessential Basque dishes, and the overarching themes were salt cod and peppers.**\n\n*Salt Cod (in many forms), including:*\n- Kokotxas al Pil-Pil - Fish cheeks and throats in a \"pil-pil\" sauce, which refers to the sound made when shaking a cazuela to activate the natural gelatin in the fish cheeks.\n- Tortilla de Bacalao - A salt cod omelet.\n- Porrusalda - Potato, leek, salt cod soup.\nPiperrada - Sauteed peppers (they use lots of peppers), onions, garlic and tomato, often served with a fried egg.\nStuffed Piquillo Peppers.\nMarmitako - Tuna with potato and pepper stew.\n\n**I also asked what some quintessential Basque beverages might be.**\n\n> Sidra (cider), which is much dryer and funkier than ciders we are familiar with, and Txakoli, slightly effervescent white wine. Both are low in alcohol and highly acidic -- perfect to drink with pintxos.\n\n**So what are pintxos?**\n\n> \"Pintxos are small, composed bites that unlike tapas, aren't meant to be shared,\" explained Miller. Fans of tapas but not always down to share every bite, we like the sound of pintxos. Basque restaurants are best known for pintxos, and at his restaurant, Miller naturally serves a variety. Among his favorites are:\n*Gildas - White anchovy, olive and pickled pepper skewer (named after 1946 Rita Hayworth role).\nSoft Boiled Quail Egg with Black Anchovy and Piquillo Peppers.\nFried Eggplant with Honey and Goat Cheese (local eggplant just started).\nWood-Fired Chorizo with Pickled Carrots.*\n\n![https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/07/c8/a9/55.jpg](/uploads/55_3a3cb7ffba.jpg)\n\n**Other than Pintxos, what are more distinguishing features of Basque cuisine that you won't find anywhere else?**\n\n> Lots of salt cod. As far back at the 15th century Basques were the best ship builders in Europe and dominated the whaling trade. When the whaling trade dried up, they began going further into the north Atlantic to fish for cod, which they salted aboard the ship as a means of preservation and then brought home. So even though cod is not present in the waters around Spain, it is the fish most commonly used in the Basque country (though almost always dried). They use more Foie Gras than other areas of Spain.\n\n**Miller serves a lot of egg dishes at Huertas, so I wondered too how important eggs were in Basque cuisine.**\n\n> [In the Basque country] they enjoy eggs at all times of day throughout Spain... Eggs are often the canvas for beautiful seafood, produce or charcuterie, such as wild mushrooms, local asparagus, jamon...\n\n**I asked what brought him to Northern Spain in the first place and what drew him to the cuisine.**\n\n> Ten years ago when I was growing up working in kitchens, Spain was at the forefront of influencing modern cooking techniques. So that was largely what attracted me to studying abroad in Madrid (as well as honing my Spanish speaking, which is helpful in NYC kitchens), as well as not knowing much about Spanish cuisine and looking forward to learning something new. When in Spain, I came to appreciate not the modern cooking, but how great the old-school pintxo and tapas bars were, how fun they were to dine in and felt that we didn't have much representation for that experience in New York. Being a native New Yorker, I think we should have the best of everything available here, and wanted to bring more great Spanish food to our city.\n\nThe food and culture of the north of Spain translates better than the south of Spain to New York. For one thing, being closer to the rest of Europe, the north is more cosmopolitan and a bit more diverse. Also, the climate in the north (and accordingly produce) is not far off from that of New York.\n\n**Now I'm hungry. I asked what a typical way to start and end a Basque meal is.**\n\n> [To start,] Txakolina and simply cooked seafood. [To finish,] there are some delicious Basque vermouths, which are a bit sweet and are had after dinner or often in the afternoon (some of which we offer, as well as making our own). They do make caramels and toffees, as well as Turron, an almond nougat. All traditional ends to a meal. There are also many cakes and tarts that are traditional.\n\n**So now that I'm ready to dive head first into Basque cuisine, what would be an approachable dish to try making at home?**\n\n> Pintxos!! Go to Despana (a Spanish specialty foods store), pick up one or two cheeses, one or two cured meats, anchovies, a tin of seafood; the greenmarket for some seasonal produce and local honey; get some good bread, toothpicks, and start trying out different combinations. Try this cheese with honey and shaved carrots, those anchovies with tomato on toast.\n",

No, the world's first hamburger comes from China.\n\n## Wait what?\n\nIf you're scratching your head right now, you're not alone. But Chinese hamburgers are very real and they definitely predate the [hamburgers we call our own](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-16-essential-regional_b_5682151) in the U.S. Known as rou jia mo, which translates to \"meat burger\" or \"meat sandwich,\" they consist of chopped meat inside a pita-like bun, and they've been around since the Qin dynasty, from about 221 BC to 207 BC. Despite the differences between this Chinese street food and our American-style [burgers](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/perfect-way-to-eat-burger_n_4704188), the rou jia mo \"[has been called the world's first hamburger](http://www.marcussamuelsson.com/news/street-food-rou-jia-mo-from-china)\".\n\nThe rou jia mo originated in the Shaanxi Province of China, and is now eaten all over the country. It's typically prepared and eaten on the street. The dough for the bun, or mo, consists of a simple mixture of wheat flour, water and maybe yeast. Of course recipes may vary, but this basic equation makes for a chewy and subtle pillow for the delicious filling. While the mo is [traditionally baked in a clay oven](https://www.starchefs.com/cook/savory/technique/rou-jia-mo-chinese-hamburger), today it's often fried in a pan. They may look a little like [Chinese steamed buns or baos](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bao-facts_n_5000963), but the dough for those are, of course, steamed, not baked or fried.\n\n![https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f59304_eda97f6eaaad4c96a80de0d235813138~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_360,h_240,al_c,q_90/f59304_eda97f6eaaad4c96a80de0d235813138~mv2.webp](/uploads/f59304_eda97f6eaaad4c96a80de0d235813138_mv2_128aac85a3.webp)\n\n\nThe meat filling might consist of chopped pork, beef, lamb or chicken that has been stewed with a variety of spices, like ginger, cloves, coriander and star anise. You might also find herbs like cilantro or greens like lettuce garnishing the sandwich.\n\nIf you've never had a Chinese hamburger, now is as great a time as any to try one.

        "content": "> Il n'y a pas d'amour plus sincère que l'amour de la nourriture\na déclaré George Bernard Shaw, et ajoutons également qu'il n'y a sans doute pas de meilleure façon d'explorer une culture que de manger avec voracité en voyageant. Oui, il existe de nombreux restaurants cinq étoiles pour lesquels il vaut la peine de réserver un voyage entier, mais il est tout aussi important de savourer des friandises classiques du monde entier.\n\n## Paella à Valence, Espagne\n\n![5b9eeba22100003000c61e59_9098d9fb0a.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba22100003000c61e59_9098d9fb0a_176b2163c1.jpeg)\n\nC'est ce plat classique à base de riz qui vient d'abord à l'esprit lorsque l'on pense à la gastronomie espagnole. Pour le meilleur, rendez-vous à la source : Valence. Et n'oubliez pas de gratter le fond de la casserole pour des bouchées paradisiaques de riz croquant ou de socarrat : l'arroz le plus savoureux qui ait jamais atterri sur votre palais.\n\n## Nasi Lemak en Malaisie\n\n![5b9eeba22400005100542e38_cf4839f0ad.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba22400005100542e38_cf4839f0ad_84f89b8451.jpeg)\n\nLe plat national de la Malaisie, le nasi lemak est un mélange de riz parfumé au lait de coco, servi avec une sauce sambal, des anchois croustillants frits, des cacahuètes grillées et du concombre et cuit avec des feuilles de pin à vis (pandan). Disponible à presque tous les coins de rue, ce classique très apprécié frappe toutes les notes.\n\n## Pintxos à Saint-Sébastien, Espagne\n\n![5b9eeba82200005600da3822_01759bd55b.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba82200005600da3822_01759bd55b_b46108e1aa.jpeg)\n\nParmi les villes les mieux classées pour les restaurants étoilés Michelin, Saint-Sébastien propose des pintxos (l'équivalent de petites tapas) avec des versions ultra créatives des classiques et au-delà. La haute cuisine espagnole brille dans ce paradis culinaire de la côte basque.\n\n## Pastel de Nata à Lisbonne\n\n![5b9eeba53c00005b000abbf4_be4ab6d075.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba53c00005b000abbf4_be4ab6d075_e909882796.jpeg)\n\nLa pâtisserie portugaise la plus emblématique, le [pastel de nata](http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20111107-a-bit-of-history-in-every-sweet-bite) est une sublime tarte à la crème avec des notes de citron, de cannelle et de vanille. Bonté beurrée au milieu, douceur croquante sur le dessus, qu'est-ce qu'il ne faut pas aimer ?\n\n## Mole à Puebla, Mexique\n\n![5b9eeba62100003100c61e5b_d99dbc2910.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba62100003100c61e5b_d99dbc2910_75979ebd04.jpeg)\n\nLa taupe, une spécialité de la ville mexicaine de Puebla, est un travail d'amour. La combinaison épicée-douce de cette sauce riche et chocolatée nécessite une préparation ardue et contient des ingrédients tels que des piments ancho, des épices comme l'anis et la coriandre, des graines de sésame, des amandes, des arachides, du pain rassis, de la cassonade, des raisins secs, du chocolat et des bananes plantains mûres. . Le plat culminant est digne des dieux.\n\n## Hot Pot du Sichuan en Chine\n\n![5b9eeba32500003500370d46_7d51fc80cd.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba32500003500370d46_7d51fc80cd_783924b96a.jpeg)\n\nCe n'est pas pour les âmes sensibles. Mais si vous êtes un amoureux extrême des épices, vous accueillerez les larmes qui jaillissent du lien parfait de douleur et de plaisir de la fondue.\n\n## Tajine au Maroc\n\n![5b9eeba93c000032000abbf6_12bb2e5346.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba93c000032000abbf6_12bb2e5346_9e0dac4fca.jpeg)\n\nCe ragoût salé cuit lentement, généralement composé de tranches de viande, de volaille ou de poisson et de beaucoup d'herbes et d'épices, est une véritable cuisine de l'âme marocaine. Cuit pendant des heures dans une marmite en terre cuite à couvercle conique (appelée tajine), ce plat irrésistible est servi avec du couscous ou du pain et se retrouve partout au Maroc.",

En tant que voyageur, il est important de vous renseigner sur ce que vous devriez et ne devriez pas faire lorsque vous visitez un nouveau lieu.\n\nEt puisque la nourriture est une si grande partie du voyage, il est important d'apprendre l'étiquette à manger de chaque nation. Il diffère grandement d'un endroit à l'autre. Par exemple, dans de nombreuses régions de Chine, il est considéré comme un compliment de [roter après un repas](https://www.buzzfeed.com/adamellis/surprising-food-etiquette-rules-from-around-the-world) ― un signe que vous avez bien mangé ― alors qu'aux États-Unis, ce même acte vous attirera un sérieux œil de côté.\n\nUn moyen facile de commettre un faux pas en mangeant à l'étranger est d'utiliser votre assiette ― devez-vous l'essuyer ou laisser de la nourriture ? Tout dépend de l'endroit où vous vous trouvez.\n\nVoici quatre nations où ce que vous faites avec votre assiette compte. Étudiez avant de faire un autre grand voyage.\n\n## Inde\n\nEn Inde, vous [devriez tout finir](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/international-food-customs-8-weird-food-etiquette-trends-from-around-the-world-thrillist- nation) qui est dans votre assiette car elle est [considérée comme un respect pour la nourriture servie](http://www.culturewavesglobal.com/india-etiquette-), et la nourriture en Inde est considérée comme sacrée. En Inde du Sud, où la nourriture peut être servie sur une feuille de bananier, il est poli de replier votre feuille par le haut et non par le bas, car [cela indique que vous n'étiez pas satisfait](http://www.cntraveler.com /stories/2007-10-17/etiquette-101-india).\n\n## Japon\n\nIl en va de même pour la finition de votre assiette au Japon. Les Japonais trouvent [impoli de laisser de la nourriture dans votre assiette](http://www.japan-talk.com/jt/new/in-Japan-you-need-to-finish-your-plate), que ce soit à la maison ou au restaurant. Il est lié à l'un des concepts fondamentaux de la culture japonaise, [mottainai](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/avoiding-waste-with-the-japanese-concept-of-'mottainai '/6722720), qui est un sentiment de regret d'avoir gaspillé quelque chose.\n\n## Chine\n\nEn Chine, cependant, laisser une assiette vide est un [signe à l'hôte que vous avez encore faim](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/international-food-customs-8-weird-food-étiquette-tendances-de-dans-le-monde-thrillist-nation). Si vous ne voulez pas manger plus de nourriture, envisagez de laisser un peu de côté pour informer l'hôte [vous en avez assez](http://www.healthytravelblog.com/2012/08/10/travel-etiquette-part- 3-manger-sans-s'embarrasser/).\n\n\n## Éthiopie\n\nLes Éthiopiens ne se soucient même pas des assiettes. Les plaques individuelles [sont considérées comme du gaspillage](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/asia/travel-tips-and-articles/76513). Les gens partagent leurs repas sur [une grande assiette commune](http://www.foodbycountry.com/Algeria-to-France/Ethiopia.html), et mangent généralement avec leurs mains en utilisant l'injera ― un type de pain plat ― pour choisir jusqu'à la nourriture. Alors, ne pensez même pas à demander votre propre assiette.",

Non, le premier hamburger au monde vient de Chine.\n\n## Attendez quoi ?\n\nSi vous vous grattez la tête en ce moment, vous n'êtes pas seul. Mais les hamburgers chinois sont bien réels et ils sont certainement antérieurs aux [hamburgers que nous appelons les nôtres](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-16-essential-regional_b_5682151) aux États-Unis Connu sous le nom de rou jia mo, qui se traduit à « hamburger à la viande » ou « sandwich à la viande », ils consistent en de la viande hachée à l'intérieur d'un petit pain de type pita, et ils existent depuis la dynastie Qin, d'environ 221 avant JC à 207 avant JC. Malgré les différences entre cette cuisine de rue chinoise et nos [burgers](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/perfect-way-to-eat-burger_n_4704188) à l'américaine, le rou jia mo \"[a été appelé le premier hamburger au monde](http://www.marcussamuelsson.com/news/street-food-rou-jia-mo-from-china)\".\n\nLe rou jia mo est originaire de la province chinoise du Shaanxi et est maintenant consommé dans tout le pays. Il est généralement préparé et mangé dans la rue. La pâte pour le petit pain, ou mo, se compose d'un simple mélange de farine de blé, d'eau et peut-être de levure. Bien sûr, les recettes peuvent varier, mais cette équation de base en fait un oreiller moelleux et subtil pour une délicieuse garniture. Alors que le mo est [traditionnellement cuit dans un four d'argile] (https://www.starchefs.com/cook/savory/technique/rou-jia-mo-chinese-hamburger), aujourd'hui, il est souvent frit dans une poêle. Ils peuvent ressembler un peu à [des petits pains ou des baos cuits à la vapeur chinois](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bao-facts_n_5000963), mais la pâte pour ceux-ci est, bien sûr, cuite à la vapeur, pas cuite ni frite.\n\n![https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f59304_eda97f6eaaad4c96a80de0d235813138~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_360,h_240,al_c,q_90/f59304_eda97f6eaaad4c96a80de0d235813138~mv680ea.webp/f](5996a28eaa2832897f6eaaad4c96a80de0d235813138~mv6.\n\n\nLa garniture à base de viande peut être composée de porc, de bœuf, d'agneau ou de poulet haché qui a été mijoté avec une variété d'épices, comme le gingembre, les clous de girofle, la coriandre et l'anis étoilé. Vous pouvez également trouver des herbes comme la coriandre ou des légumes verts comme la laitue pour garnir le sandwich.\n\nSi vous n'avez jamais mangé de hamburger chinois, c'est le moment idéal pour en essayer un.

Cependant, la cuisine basque vaut la peine d'être connue, et avec un afflux de restaurants d'inspiration basque dans des villes gourmandes comme New York, il semble que cette tradition culinaire prenne la place qu'elle mérite.\n\nLe Pays Basque se situe au nord de l'Espagne près du golfe de Gascogne et dans le sud-ouest de la France. Avec un sol fertile pour les céréales et les vignobles dans une région appelée Álava, et de bonnes terres pour l'élevage en Biscaye et Guipúzcoa, le pays basque possède un riche patrimoine culinaire. Il n'est donc pas étonnant qu'aujourd'hui la région compte [presque 40 restaurants étoilés Michelin] (http://www.euskoguide.com/food-drink-basque-country/michelin-star-restaurants.html).\n\nJ'ai parlé au chef exécutif et propriétaire du nouveau restaurant d'inspiration basque [Huertas] (http://huertasnyc.com/t) à New York pour en savoir plus sur la cuisine unique. Il y a dix ans, après avoir travaillé dans certains des restaurants les plus en vue de New York, le chef Jonah Miller s'est envolé pour le nord de l'Espagne pour en savoir plus. En avril de cette année, il a ouvert son premier restaurant, dédié à la nourriture qu'il a étudiée et dont il est tombé amoureux.\n\n**J'ai demandé à Jonah de décrire certains plats basques par excellence, et les thèmes dominants étaient la morue salée et les poivrons.**\n\n* Morue salée (sous de nombreuses formes), y compris :*\n- Kokotxas al Pil-Pil - Joues et gorges de poisson dans une sauce \"pil-pil\", qui fait référence au son émis en secouant une cazuela pour activer la gélatine naturelle dans les joues de poisson.\n- Tortilla de Bacalao - Une omelette à la morue salée.\n- Porrusalda - Soupe de pommes de terre, poireaux, morue salée.\nPiperrada - Poivrons sautés (ils utilisent beaucoup de poivrons), oignons, ail et tomate, souvent servis avec un œuf au plat.\nPoivrons de Piquillo farcis.\nMarmitako - Thon avec ragoût de pommes de terre et poivrons.\n\n**J'ai également demandé quelles pourraient être les boissons basques par excellence.**\n\n> Sidra (cidre), beaucoup plus sec et funky que les cidres que nous connaissons, et Txakoli, vin blanc légèrement effervescent. Les deux sont faibles en alcool et très acides - parfaits à boire avec des pintxos.\n\n**Alors, que sont les pintxos ?**\n\n> \"Les pintxos sont de petites bouchées composées qui, contrairement aux tapas, ne sont pas destinées à être partagées\", a expliqué Miller. Amateurs de tapas mais pas toujours prêts à partager chaque bouchée, on aime le son des pintxos. Les restaurants basques sont surtout connus pour les pintxos, et dans son restaurant, Miller sert naturellement une variété. Parmi ses favoris figurent :\n*Gildas - Brochette d'anchois blancs, d'olives et de poivrons marinés (nommée d'après le rôle de Rita Hayworth en 1946).\nEgguf de caille mollet aux anchois noirs et piments piquillos.\nAubergine frite au miel et au fromage de chèvre (l'aubergine locale vient de commencer).\nChorizo ​​au feu de bois avec carottes marinées.*\n\n![https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/07/c8/a9/55.jpg](/uploads/55_3a3cb7ffba.jpg)\n\n**Au-delà des pintxos, quelles sont les caractéristiques les plus distinctives de la cuisine basque que vous ne trouverez nulle part ailleurs ?**\n\n> Beaucoup de morue salée. Dès le XVe siècle, les Basques étaient les meilleurs constructeurs de navires d'Europe et dominaient le commerce de la chasse à la baleine. Lorsque le commerce de la chasse à la baleine s'est tari, ils ont commencé à aller plus loin dans l'Atlantique Nord pour pêcher la morue, qu'ils ont salée à bord du navire comme moyen de conservation et qu'ils ont ensuite ramenée chez eux. Ainsi, même si la morue n'est pas présente dans les eaux autour de l'Espagne, c'est le poisson le plus couramment utilisé au Pays basque (bien que presque toujours séché). Ils utilisent plus de Foie Gras que d'autres régions d'Espagne.\n\n**Miller sert beaucoup de plats aux œufs à Huertas, alors je me suis demandé aussi quelle était l'importance des œufs dans la cuisine basque.**\n\n> [Au Pays basque] on se régale d'œufs à toute heure de la journée dans toute l'Espagne... Les œufs sont souvent la toile de beaux fruits de mer, produits frais ou charcuterie, comme les champignons sauvages, les asperges locales, le jambon...\n\n**J'ai demandé ce qui l'avait amené dans le nord de l'Espagne en premier lieu et ce qui l'avait attiré vers la cuisine.**\n\n> Il y a dix ans, lorsque j'ai grandi dans la cuisine, l'Espagne était à l'avant-garde pour influencer les techniques de cuisson modernes. C'est donc en grande partie ce qui m'a attiré à étudier à l'étranger à Madrid (ainsi qu'à perfectionner mon espagnol, ce qui est utile dans les cuisines de New York), ainsi qu'à ne pas trop connaître la cuisine espagnole et à avoir hâte d'apprendre quelque chose de nouveau. Quand en Espagne, j'ai appris à apprécier non pas la cuisine moderne, mais à quel point les bars à pintxo et à tapas à l'ancienne étaient formidables, à quel point ils étaient amusants à dîner et j'ai senti que nous n'avions pas beaucoup de représentation pour cette expérience à New York. Étant originaire de New York, je pense que nous devrions avoir le meilleur de tout ce qui est disponible ici et que nous voulions apporter plus de bonne cuisine espagnole dans notre ville.\n\nLa nourriture et la culture du nord de l'Espagne se traduisent mieux que celles du sud de l'Espagne à New York.

En tant que voyageur, il est important de vous renseigner sur ce que vous devriez et ne devriez pas faire lorsque vous visitez un nouveau lieu.\n\nEt puisque la nourriture est une si grande partie du voyage, il est important d'apprendre l'étiquette à manger de chaque nation. Il diffère grandement d'un endroit à l'autre. Par exemple, dans de nombreuses régions de Chine, il est considéré comme un compliment de [roter après un repas](https://www.buzzfeed.com/adamellis/surprising-food-etiquette-rules-from-around-the-world) ― un signe que vous avez bien mangé ― alors qu'aux États-Unis, ce même acte vous attirera un sérieux œil de côté.\n\nUn moyen facile de commettre un faux pas en mangeant à l'étranger est d'utiliser votre assiette ― devez-vous l'essuyer ou laisser de la nourriture ? Tout dépend de l'endroit où vous vous trouvez.\n\nVoici quatre nations où ce que vous faites avec votre assiette compte. Étudiez avant de faire un autre grand voyage.\n\n## Inde\n\nEn Inde, vous [devriez tout finir](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/international-food-customs-8-weird-food-etiquette-trends-from-around-the-world-thrillist- nation) qui est dans votre assiette car elle est [considérée comme un respect pour la nourriture servie](http://www.culturewavesglobal.com/india-etiquette-), et la nourriture en Inde est considérée comme sacrée. En Inde du Sud, où la nourriture peut être servie sur une feuille de bananier, il est poli de replier votre feuille par le haut et non par le bas, car [cela indique que vous n'étiez pas satisfait](http://www.cntraveler.com /stories/2007-10-17/etiquette-101-india).\n\n## Japon\n\nIl en va de même pour la finition de votre assiette au Japon. Les Japonais trouvent [impoli de laisser de la nourriture dans votre assiette](http://www.japan-talk.com/jt/new/in-Japan-you-need-to-finish-your-plate), que ce soit à la maison ou au restaurant. Il est lié à l'un des concepts fondamentaux de la culture japonaise, [mottainai](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/avoiding-waste-with-the-japanese-concept-of-'mottainai '/6722720), qui est un sentiment de regret d'avoir gaspillé quelque chose.\n\n## Chine\n\nEn Chine, cependant, laisser une assiette vide est un [signe à l'hôte que vous avez encore faim](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/international-food-customs-8-weird-food-étiquette-tendances-de-dans-le-monde-thrillist-nation). Si vous ne voulez pas manger plus de nourriture, envisagez de laisser un peu de côté pour informer l'hôte [vous en avez assez](http://www.healthytravelblog.com/2012/08/10/travel-etiquette-part- 3-manger-sans-s'embarrasser/).\n\n\n## Éthiopie\n\nLes Éthiopiens ne se soucient même pas des assiettes. Les plaques individuelles [sont considérées comme du gaspillage](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/asia/travel-tips-and-articles/76513). Les gens partagent leurs repas sur [une grande assiette commune](http://www.foodbycountry.com/Algeria-to-France/Ethiopia.html), et mangent généralement avec leurs mains en utilisant l'injera ― un type de pain plat ― pour choisir jusqu'à la nourriture. Alors, ne pensez même pas à demander votre propre assiette.",

                "content": "> Il n'y a pas d'amour plus sincère que l'amour de la nourriture\na déclaré George Bernard Shaw, et ajoutons également qu'il n'y a sans doute pas de meilleure façon d'explorer une culture que de manger avec voracité en voyageant. Oui, il existe de nombreux restaurants cinq étoiles pour lesquels il vaut la peine de réserver un voyage entier, mais il est tout aussi important de savourer des friandises classiques du monde entier.\n\n## Paella à Valence, Espagne\n\n![5b9eeba22100003000c61e59_9098d9fb0a.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba22100003000c61e59_9098d9fb0a_176b2163c1.jpeg)\n\nC'est ce plat classique à base de riz qui vient d'abord à l'esprit lorsque l'on pense à la gastronomie espagnole. Pour le meilleur, rendez-vous à la source : Valence. Et n'oubliez pas de gratter le fond de la casserole pour des bouchées paradisiaques de riz croquant ou de socarrat : l'arroz le plus savoureux qui ait jamais atterri sur votre palais.\n\n## Nasi Lemak en Malaisie\n\n![5b9eeba22400005100542e38_cf4839f0ad.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba22400005100542e38_cf4839f0ad_84f89b8451.jpeg)\n\nLe plat national de la Malaisie, le nasi lemak est un mélange de riz parfumé au lait de coco, servi avec une sauce sambal, des anchois croustillants frits, des cacahuètes grillées et du concombre et cuit avec des feuilles de pin à vis (pandan). Disponible à presque tous les coins de rue, ce classique très apprécié frappe toutes les notes.\n\n## Pintxos à Saint-Sébastien, Espagne\n\n![5b9eeba82200005600da3822_01759bd55b.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba82200005600da3822_01759bd55b_b46108e1aa.jpeg)\n\nParmi les villes les mieux classées pour les restaurants étoilés Michelin, Saint-Sébastien propose des pintxos (l'équivalent de petites tapas) avec des versions ultra créatives des classiques et au-delà. La haute cuisine espagnole brille dans ce paradis culinaire de la côte basque.\n\n## Pastel de Nata à Lisbonne\n\n![5b9eeba53c00005b000abbf4_be4ab6d075.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba53c00005b000abbf4_be4ab6d075_e909882796.jpeg)\n\nLa pâtisserie portugaise la plus emblématique, le [pastel de nata](http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20111107-a-bit-of-history-in-every-sweet-bite) est une sublime tarte à la crème avec des notes de citron, de cannelle et de vanille. Bonté beurrée au milieu, douceur croquante sur le dessus, qu'est-ce qu'il ne faut pas aimer ?\n\n## Mole à Puebla, Mexique\n\n![5b9eeba62100003100c61e5b_d99dbc2910.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba62100003100c61e5b_d99dbc2910_75979ebd04.jpeg)\n\nLa taupe, une spécialité de la ville mexicaine de Puebla, est un travail d'amour. La combinaison épicée-douce de cette sauce riche et chocolatée nécessite une préparation ardue et contient des ingrédients tels que des piments ancho, des épices comme l'anis et la coriandre, des graines de sésame, des amandes, des arachides, du pain rassis, de la cassonade, des raisins secs, du chocolat et des bananes plantains mûres. . Le plat culminant est digne des dieux.\n\n## Hot Pot du Sichuan en Chine\n\n![5b9eeba32500003500370d46_7d51fc80cd.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba32500003500370d46_7d51fc80cd_783924b96a.jpeg)\n\nCe n'est pas pour les âmes sensibles. Mais si vous êtes un amoureux extrême des épices, vous accueillerez les larmes qui jaillissent du lien parfait de douleur et de plaisir de la fondue.\n\n## Tajine au Maroc\n\n![5b9eeba93c000032000abbf6_12bb2e5346.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba93c000032000abbf6_12bb2e5346_9e0dac4fca.jpeg)\n\nCe ragoût salé cuit lentement, généralement composé de tranches de viande, de volaille ou de poisson et de beaucoup d'herbes et d'épices, est une véritable cuisine de l'âme marocaine. Cuit pendant des heures dans une marmite en terre cuite à couvercle conique (appelée tajine), ce plat irrésistible est servi avec du couscous ou du pain et se retrouve partout au Maroc.",

                "content": "Grâce à [Ferran Adrià](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-measure-the-restau_b_5475536), des tapas et une fascination pour tout ce qui concerne le porc - du chorizo ​​aux chicharrones - la cuisine espagnole a été une star dans le monde de l'alimentation ces dernières années. Mais une partie moins familière de la cuisine espagnole est basque - considérablement unique et différente de la cuisine espagnole plus large qui a été exportée à travers le monde. Cependant, la cuisine basque vaut la peine d'être connue, et avec un afflux de restaurants d'inspiration basque dans des villes gourmandes comme New York, il semble que cette tradition culinaire prenne la place qu'elle mérite.\n\nLe Pays Basque se situe au nord de l'Espagne près du golfe de Gascogne et dans le sud-ouest de la France. Avec un sol fertile pour les céréales et les vignobles dans une région appelée Álava, et de bonnes terres pour l'élevage en Biscaye et Guipúzcoa, le pays basque possède un riche patrimoine culinaire. Il n'est donc pas étonnant qu'aujourd'hui la région compte [presque 40 restaurants étoilés Michelin] (http://www.euskoguide.com/food-drink-basque-country/michelin-star-restaurants.html).\n\nJ'ai parlé au chef exécutif et propriétaire du nouveau restaurant d'inspiration basque [Huertas] (http://huertasnyc.com/t) à New York pour en savoir plus sur la cuisine unique. Il y a dix ans, après avoir travaillé dans certains des restaurants les plus en vue de New York, le chef Jonah Miller s'est envolé pour le nord de l'Espagne pour en savoir plus. En avril de cette année, il a ouvert son premier restaurant, dédié à la nourriture qu'il a étudiée et dont il est tombé amoureux.\n\n**J'ai demandé à Jonah de décrire certains plats basques par excellence, et les thèmes dominants étaient la morue salée et les poivrons.**\n\n* Morue salée (sous de nombreuses formes), y compris :*\n- Kokotxas al Pil-Pil - Joues et gorges de poisson dans une sauce \"pil-pil\", qui fait référence au son émis en secouant une cazuela pour activer la gélatine naturelle dans les joues de poisson.\n- Tortilla de Bacalao - Une omelette à la morue salée.\n- Porrusalda - Soupe de pommes de terre, poireaux, morue salée.\nPiperrada - Poivrons sautés (ils utilisent beaucoup de poivrons), oignons, ail et tomate, souvent servis avec un œuf au plat.\nPoivrons de Piquillo farcis.\nMarmitako - Thon avec ragoût de pommes de terre et poivrons.\n\n**J'ai également demandé quelles pourraient être les boissons basques par excellence.**\n\n> Sidra (cidre), beaucoup plus sec et funky que les cidres que nous connaissons, et Txakoli, vin blanc légèrement effervescent. Les deux sont faibles en alcool et très acides - parfaits à boire avec des pintxos.\n\n**Alors, que sont les pintxos ?**\n\n> \"Les pintxos sont de petites bouchées composées qui, contrairement aux tapas, ne sont pas destinées à être partagées\", a expliqué Miller. Amateurs de tapas mais pas toujours prêts à partager chaque bouchée, on aime le son des pintxos. Les restaurants basques sont surtout connus pour les pintxos, et dans son restaurant, Miller sert naturellement une variété. Parmi ses favoris figurent :\n*Gildas - Brochette d'anchois blancs, d'olives et de poivrons marinés (nommée d'après le rôle de Rita Hayworth en 1946).\nEgguf de caille mollet aux anchois noirs et piments piquillos.\nAubergine frite au miel et au fromage de chèvre (l'aubergine locale vient de commencer).\nChorizo ​​au feu de bois avec carottes marinées.*\n\n![https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/07/c8/a9/55.jpg](/uploads/55_3a3cb7ffba.jpg)\n\n**Au-delà des pintxos, quelles sont les caractéristiques les plus distinctives de la cuisine basque que vous ne trouverez nulle part ailleurs ?**\n\n> Beaucoup de morue salée. Dès le XVe siècle, les Basques étaient les meilleurs constructeurs de navires d'Europe et dominaient le commerce de la chasse à la baleine. Lorsque le commerce de la chasse à la baleine s'est tari, ils ont commencé à aller plus loin dans l'Atlantique Nord pour pêcher la morue, qu'ils ont salée à bord du navire comme moyen de conservation et qu'ils ont ensuite ramenée chez eux. Ainsi, même si la morue n'est pas présente dans les eaux autour de l'Espagne, c'est le poisson le plus couramment utilisé au Pays basque (bien que presque toujours séché). Ils utilisent plus de Foie Gras que d'autres régions d'Espagne.\n\n**Miller sert beaucoup de plats aux œufs à Huertas, alors je me suis demandé aussi quelle était l'importance des œufs dans la cuisine basque.**\n\n> [Au Pays basque] on se régale d'œufs à toute heure de la journée dans toute l'Espagne... Les œufs sont souvent la toile de beaux fruits de mer, produits frais ou charcuterie, comme les champignons sauvages, les asperges locales, le jambon...\n\n**J'ai demandé ce qui l'avait amené dans le nord de l'Espagne en premier lieu et ce qui l'avait attiré vers la cuisine.**\n\n> Il y a dix ans, lorsque j'ai grandi dans la cuisine, l'Espagne était à l'avant-garde pour influencer les techniques de cuisson modernes. C'est donc en grande partie ce qui m'a attiré à étudier à l'étranger à Madrid (ainsi qu'à perfectionner mon espagnol, ce qui est utile dans les cuisines de New York), ainsi qu'à ne pas trop connaître la cuisine espagnole et à avoir hâte d'apprendre quelque chose de nouveau. Quand en Espagne, j'ai appris à apprécier non pas la cuisine moderne, mais à quel point les bars à pintxo et à tapas à l'ancienne étaient formidables, à quel point ils étaient amusants à dîner et j'ai senti que nous n'avions pas beaucoup de représentation pour cette expérience à New York. Étant originaire de New York, je pense que nous devrions avoir le meilleur de tout ce qui est disponible ici et que nous voulions apporter plus de bonne cuisine espagnole dans notre ville.\n\nLa nourriture et la culture du nord de l'Espagne se traduisent mieux que celles du sud de l'Espagne à New York.

Non, le premier hamburger au monde vient de Chine.\n\n## Attendez quoi ?\n\nSi vous vous grattez la tête en ce moment, vous n'êtes pas seul. Mais les hamburgers chinois sont bien réels et ils sont certainement antérieurs aux [hamburgers que nous appelons les nôtres](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-16-essential-regional_b_5682151) aux États-Unis Connu sous le nom de rou jia mo, qui se traduit à « hamburger à la viande » ou « sandwich à la viande », ils consistent en de la viande hachée à l'intérieur d'un petit pain de type pita, et ils existent depuis la dynastie Qin, d'environ 221 avant JC à 207 avant JC. Malgré les différences entre cette cuisine de rue chinoise et nos [burgers](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/perfect-way-to-eat-burger_n_4704188) à l'américaine, le rou jia mo \"[a été appelé le premier hamburger au monde](http://www.marcussamuelsson.com/news/street-food-rou-jia-mo-from-china)\".\n\nLe rou jia mo est originaire de la province chinoise du Shaanxi et est maintenant consommé dans tout le pays. Il est généralement préparé et mangé dans la rue. La pâte pour le petit pain, ou mo, se compose d'un simple mélange de farine de blé, d'eau et peut-être de levure. Bien sûr, les recettes peuvent varier, mais cette équation de base en fait un oreiller moelleux et subtil pour une délicieuse garniture. Alors que le mo est [traditionnellement cuit dans un four d'argile] (https://www.starchefs.com/cook/savory/technique/rou-jia-mo-chinese-hamburger), aujourd'hui, il est souvent frit dans une poêle. Ils peuvent ressembler un peu à [des petits pains ou des baos cuits à la vapeur chinois](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bao-facts_n_5000963), mais la pâte pour ceux-ci est, bien sûr, cuite à la vapeur, pas cuite ni frite.\n\n![https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f59304_eda97f6eaaad4c96a80de0d235813138~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_360,h_240,al_c,q_90/f59304_eda97f6eaaad4c96a80de0d235813138~mv680ea.webp/f](5996a28eaa2832897f6eaaad4c96a80de0d235813138~mv6.\n\n\nLa garniture à base de viande peut être composée de porc, de bœuf, d'agneau ou de poulet haché qui a été mijoté avec une variété d'épices, comme le gingembre, les clous de girofle, la coriandre et l'anis étoilé. Vous pouvez également trouver des herbes comme la coriandre ou des légumes verts comme la laitue pour garnir le sandwich.\n\nSi vous n'avez jamais mangé de hamburger chinois, c'est le moment idéal pour en essayer un.

        "content": "Thanks to [Ferran Adrià](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-measure-the-restau_b_5475536), tapas and a fascination with all things pork -- from chorizo to chicharrones -- Spanish cuisine has been a star in the food world in recent years. But a less familiar part of Spanish cuisine is Basque -- considerably unique and different from the broader Spanish cuisine that has been exported across the globe. Basque cuisine is worth getting to know, however, and with an influx of Basque-inspired restaurants in food-forward cities like New York, it appears that this culinary tradition is gaining the foothold it deserves.\n\nBasque country lies in the North of Spain near the Bay of Biscay and in South Western France. With fertile ground for grains and vineyards in an area called Álava, and good land for livestock breeding in Vizcaya and Guipúzcoa, Basque country has a rich culinary heritage. It's no wonder then that today the region boasts [almost 40 Michelin starred restaurants](http://www.euskoguide.com/food-drink-basque-country/michelin-star-restaurants.html).\n\nI spoke to executive chef and owner of the new Basque-inspired restaurant [Huertas](http://huertasnyc.com/t) in New York City to learn more about the unique cuisine. Ten years ago, after working in some of New York's most prominent restaurants, chef Jonah Miller took off for Northern Spain to learn more. In April of this year he opened his first restaurant, dedicated to the food he studied and fell in love with.\n\n**I asked Jonah to describe some quintessential Basque dishes, and the overarching themes were salt cod and peppers.**\n\n*Salt Cod (in many forms), including:*\n- Kokotxas al Pil-Pil - Fish cheeks and throats in a \"pil-pil\" sauce, which refers to the sound made when shaking a cazuela to activate the natural gelatin in the fish cheeks.\n- Tortilla de Bacalao - A salt cod omelet.\n- Porrusalda - Potato, leek, salt cod soup.\nPiperrada - Sauteed peppers (they use lots of peppers), onions, garlic and tomato, often served with a fried egg.\nStuffed Piquillo Peppers.\nMarmitako - Tuna with potato and pepper stew.\n\n**I also asked what some quintessential Basque beverages might be.**\n\n> Sidra (cider), which is much dryer and funkier than ciders we are familiar with, and Txakoli, slightly effervescent white wine. Both are low in alcohol and highly acidic -- perfect to drink with pintxos.\n\n**So what are pintxos?**\n\n> \"Pintxos are small, composed bites that unlike tapas, aren't meant to be shared,\" explained Miller. Fans of tapas but not always down to share every bite, we like the sound of pintxos. Basque restaurants are best known for pintxos, and at his restaurant, Miller naturally serves a variety. Among his favorites are:\n*Gildas - White anchovy, olive and pickled pepper skewer (named after 1946 Rita Hayworth role).\nSoft Boiled Quail Egg with Black Anchovy and Piquillo Peppers.\nFried Eggplant with Honey and Goat Cheese (local eggplant just started).\nWood-Fired Chorizo with Pickled Carrots.*\n\n![https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/07/c8/a9/55.jpg](/uploads/55_3a3cb7ffba.jpg)\n\n**Other than Pintxos, what are more distinguishing features of Basque cuisine that you won't find anywhere else?**\n\n> Lots of salt cod. As far back at the 15th century Basques were the best ship builders in Europe and dominated the whaling trade. When the whaling trade dried up, they began going further into the north Atlantic to fish for cod, which they salted aboard the ship as a means of preservation and then brought home. So even though cod is not present in the waters around Spain, it is the fish most commonly used in the Basque country (though almost always dried). They use more Foie Gras than other areas of Spain.\n\n**Miller serves a lot of egg dishes at Huertas, so I wondered too how important eggs were in Basque cuisine.**\n\n> [In the Basque country] they enjoy eggs at all times of day throughout Spain... Eggs are often the canvas for beautiful seafood, produce or charcuterie, such as wild mushrooms, local asparagus, jamon...\n\n**I asked what brought him to Northern Spain in the first place and what drew him to the cuisine.**\n\n> Ten years ago when I was growing up working in kitchens, Spain was at the forefront of influencing modern cooking techniques. So that was largely what attracted me to studying abroad in Madrid (as well as honing my Spanish speaking, which is helpful in NYC kitchens), as well as not knowing much about Spanish cuisine and looking forward to learning something new. When in Spain, I came to appreciate not the modern cooking, but how great the old-school pintxo and tapas bars were, how fun they were to dine in and felt that we didn't have much representation for that experience in New York. Being a native New Yorker, I think we should have the best of everything available here, and wanted to bring more great Spanish food to our city.\n\nThe food and culture of the north of Spain translates better than the south of Spain to New York. For one thing, being closer to the rest of Europe, the north is more cosmopolitan and a bit more diverse. Also, the climate in the north (and accordingly produce) is not far off from that of New York.\n\n**Now I'm hungry. I asked what a typical way to start and end a Basque meal is.**\n\n> [To start,] Txakolina and simply cooked seafood. [To finish,] there are some delicious Basque vermouths, which are a bit sweet and are had after dinner or often in the afternoon (some of which we offer, as well as making our own). They do make caramels and toffees, as well as Turron, an almond nougat. All traditional ends to a meal. There are also many cakes and tarts that are traditional.\n\n**So now that I'm ready to dive head first into Basque cuisine, what would be an approachable dish to try making at home?**\n\n> Pintxos!! Go to Despana (a Spanish specialty foods store), pick up one or two cheeses, one or two cured meats, anchovies, a tin of seafood; the greenmarket for some seasonal produce and local honey; get some good bread, toothpicks, and start trying out different combinations. Try this cheese with honey and shaved carrots, those anchovies with tomato on toast.\n",

                "content": "Across the globe, there are many cultural differences that define each country. As a traveler, it’s important to educate yourself on what you should and shouldn’t do when visiting a new locale.\n\nAnd since food is such a big part of travel, it’s important to learn the dining etiquette of each nation. It differs greatly from place to place. For example, in many areas of China it’s considered a compliment to [burp after a meal](https://www.buzzfeed.com/adamellis/surprising-food-etiquette-rules-from-around-the-world) ― a sign that you’ve eaten well ― while stateside, that same act will get you some serious side eye.\n\nOne easy way you can commit a faux pas while eating abroad is with your plate ― should you wipe it clean or leave some food? It all depends on where you are.\n\nHere are four nations where what you do with your plate matters. Study up before you make another big trip.\n\n## India \n\nIn India, you [should finish everything](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/international-food-customs-8-weird-food-etiquette-trends-from-around-the-world-thrillist-nation) that is on your plate because it is [considered a respect for the served food](http://www.culturewavesglobal.com/india-etiquette-), and food in India is considered sacred. In South India, where food can be served on a banana leaf, it is polite to fold your leaf over from the top ― not from the bottom, because [that indicates you were not satisfied](http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2007-10-17/etiquette-101-india).\n\n## Japan\n\nThe same is true about finishing your plate in Japan. The Japanese consider it [rude to leave food on your plate](http://www.japan-talk.com/jt/new/in-Japan-you-need-to-finish-your-plate), whether at home or at a restaurant. It’s related to one of the fundamental concepts in Japanese culture, [mottainai](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/avoiding-waste-with-the-japanese-concept-of-'mottainai'/6722720), which is a feeling of regret at having wasted something.\n\n## China\n\nIn China, however, leaving behind an empty plate is a [sign to the host that you’re still hungry](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/international-food-customs-8-weird-food-etiquette-trends-from-around-the-world-thrillist-nation). If you don’t want to eat more food, consider leaving a little behind to let the host know [you have had enough](http://www.healthytravelblog.com/2012/08/10/travel-etiquette-part-3-eating-without-embarrassing-yourself/).\n\n\n## Ethiopia\n\nEthiopians don’t even bother with plates. Individual plates [are considered wasteful](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/asia/travel-tips-and-articles/76513?lpaffil=lp-affiliates). Folks share meals off of [one big communal plate](http://www.foodbycountry.com/Algeria-to-France/Ethiopia.html), and generally eat with their hands using injera ― a type of flat bread ― to pick up the food. So, don’t even think about asking for your own plate.\n",

Yes, there are many five-star restaurants worth booking an entire trip for, but it's equally important to savor classic treats from across the world.\n\n## Paella in Valencia, Spain\n\n![5b9eeba22100003000c61e59_9098d9fb0a.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba22100003000c61e59_9098d9fb0a_176b2163c1.jpeg)\n\nIt’s this classic rice-based dish that first pops to mind when thinking of Spanish gastronomy. For the best there is, head to the source: Valencia. And don’t forget to scrape the bottom of the pan for heavenly bites of crunchy rice, or socarrat: the most flavorful arroz ever to land on your palate.\n\n## Nasi Lemak in Malaysia\n\n![5b9eeba22400005100542e38_cf4839f0ad.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba22400005100542e38_cf4839f0ad_84f89b8451.jpeg)\n\nMalaysia’s national dish, nasi lemak is a fragrant coconut-milk rice mixture, served with sambal sauce, fried crispy anchovies, toasted peanuts, and cucumber and cooked with screw pine (pandan) leaves. Available on almost every street corner, this much-loved classic hits all the notes.\n\n## Pintxos in San Sebastián, Spain\n\n![5b9eeba82200005600da3822_01759bd55b.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba82200005600da3822_01759bd55b_b46108e1aa.jpeg)\n\nAmong the most highly ranked cities for Michelin-starred restaurants, San Sebastián boasts pintxos (the equivalent of small tapas) with über-creative takes on classics and beyond. Spain’s haute cuisine shines in this culinary paradise on the Basque coast.\n\n## Pastel de Nata in Lisbon\n\n![5b9eeba53c00005b000abbf4_be4ab6d075.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba53c00005b000abbf4_be4ab6d075_e909882796.jpeg)\n\nThe most iconic Portuguese pastry, the [pastel de nata](http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20111107-a-bit-of-history-in-every-sweet-bite) is a sublime custard tart with hints of lemon, cinnamon, and vanilla. Buttery goodness in the middle, crunchy sweetness on top—what’s not to love?\n\n## Mole in Puebla, Mexico\n\n![5b9eeba62100003100c61e5b_d99dbc2910.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba62100003100c61e5b_d99dbc2910_75979ebd04.jpeg)\n\nMole, a specialty in the Mexican city of Puebla, is a labor of love. The spicy-sweet combination of this rich, chocolate-colored sauce takes arduous preparation and packs ingredients such as ancho chiles, spices like anise and coriander, sesame seeds, almonds, peanuts, stale bread, brown sugar, raisins, chocolate, and ripe plantains. The culminating dish is fit for the gods.\n\n## Sichuan Hot Pot in China\n\n![5b9eeba32500003500370d46_7d51fc80cd.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba32500003500370d46_7d51fc80cd_783924b96a.jpeg)\n\nThis isn’t for the faint of heart. But if you’re an extreme spice lover, you’ll welcome the tears that come from the hot pot’s perfect nexus of pain and pleasure.\n\n## Tagine in Morocco\n\n![5b9eeba93c000032000abbf6_12bb2e5346.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba93c000032000abbf6_12bb2e5346_9e0dac4fca.jpeg)\n\nThis slow-cooked savory stew, typically made with sliced meat, poultry, or fish and lots of herbs and spices, is true Moroccan soul food. Cooked for hours in a clay cooking pot with a conical lid (known as a tagine), this irresistible dish is served with couscous or bread and can be found all over Morocco.\n\n",

                "content": "The world's first hamburger doesn't come from where you think it comes from. It wasn't invented in the United States, and it didn't originate in Germany. No, the world's first hamburger comes from China.\n\n## Wait what?\n\nIf you're scratching your head right now, you're not alone. But Chinese hamburgers are very real and they definitely predate the [hamburgers we call our own](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-16-essential-regional_b_5682151) in the U.S. Known as rou jia mo, which translates to \"meat burger\" or \"meat sandwich,\" they consist of chopped meat inside a pita-like bun, and they've been around since the Qin dynasty, from about 221 BC to 207 BC. Despite the differences between this Chinese street food and our American-style [burgers](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/perfect-way-to-eat-burger_n_4704188), the rou jia mo \"[has been called the world's first hamburger](http://www.marcussamuelsson.com/news/street-food-rou-jia-mo-from-china)\".\n\nThe rou jia mo originated in the Shaanxi Province of China, and is now eaten all over the country. It's typically prepared and eaten on the street. The dough for the bun, or mo, consists of a simple mixture of wheat flour, water and maybe yeast. Of course recipes may vary, but this basic equation makes for a chewy and subtle pillow for the delicious filling. While the mo is [traditionally baked in a clay oven](https://www.starchefs.com/cook/savory/technique/rou-jia-mo-chinese-hamburger), today it's often fried in a pan. They may look a little like [Chinese steamed buns or baos](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bao-facts_n_5000963), but the dough for those are, of course, steamed, not baked or fried.\n\n![https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f59304_eda97f6eaaad4c96a80de0d235813138~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_360,h_240,al_c,q_90/f59304_eda97f6eaaad4c96a80de0d235813138~mv2.webp](/uploads/f59304_eda97f6eaaad4c96a80de0d235813138_mv2_128aac85a3.webp)\n\n\nThe meat filling might consist of chopped pork, beef, lamb or chicken that has been stewed with a variety of spices, like ginger, cloves, coriander and star anise. You might also find herbs like cilantro or greens like lettuce garnishing the sandwich.\n\nIf you've never had a Chinese hamburger, now is as great a time as any to try one.

        "content": "Grâce à [Ferran Adrià](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-measure-the-restau_b_5475536), des tapas et une fascination pour tout ce qui concerne le porc - du chorizo ​​aux chicharrones - la cuisine espagnole a été une star dans le monde de l'alimentation ces dernières années. Mais une partie moins familière de la cuisine espagnole est basque - considérablement unique et différente de la cuisine espagnole plus large qui a été exportée à travers le monde. Cependant, la cuisine basque vaut la peine d'être connue, et avec un afflux de restaurants d'inspiration basque dans des villes gourmandes comme New York, il semble que cette tradition culinaire prenne la place qu'elle mérite.\n\nLe Pays Basque se situe au nord de l'Espagne près du golfe de Gascogne et dans le sud-ouest de la France. Avec un sol fertile pour les céréales et les vignobles dans une région appelée Álava, et de bonnes terres pour l'élevage en Biscaye et Guipúzcoa, le pays basque possède un riche patrimoine culinaire. Il n'est donc pas étonnant qu'aujourd'hui la région compte [presque 40 restaurants étoilés Michelin] (http://www.euskoguide.com/food-drink-basque-country/michelin-star-restaurants.html).\n\nJ'ai parlé au chef exécutif et propriétaire du nouveau restaurant d'inspiration basque [Huertas] (http://huertasnyc.com/t) à New York pour en savoir plus sur la cuisine unique. Il y a dix ans, après avoir travaillé dans certains des restaurants les plus en vue de New York, le chef Jonah Miller s'est envolé pour le nord de l'Espagne pour en savoir plus. En avril de cette année, il a ouvert son premier restaurant, dédié à la nourriture qu'il a étudiée et dont il est tombé amoureux.\n\n**J'ai demandé à Jonah de décrire certains plats basques par excellence, et les thèmes dominants étaient la morue salée et les poivrons.**\n\n* Morue salée (sous de nombreuses formes), y compris :*\n- Kokotxas al Pil-Pil - Joues et gorges de poisson dans une sauce \"pil-pil\", qui fait référence au son émis en secouant une cazuela pour activer la gélatine naturelle dans les joues de poisson.\n- Tortilla de Bacalao - Une omelette à la morue salée.\n- Porrusalda - Soupe de pommes de terre, poireaux, morue salée.\nPiperrada - Poivrons sautés (ils utilisent beaucoup de poivrons), oignons, ail et tomate, souvent servis avec un œuf au plat.\nPoivrons de Piquillo farcis.\nMarmitako - Thon avec ragoût de pommes de terre et poivrons.\n\n**J'ai également demandé quelles pourraient être les boissons basques par excellence.**\n\n> Sidra (cidre), beaucoup plus sec et funky que les cidres que nous connaissons, et Txakoli, vin blanc légèrement effervescent. Les deux sont faibles en alcool et très acides - parfaits à boire avec des pintxos.\n\n**Alors, que sont les pintxos ?**\n\n> \"Les pintxos sont de petites bouchées composées qui, contrairement aux tapas, ne sont pas destinées à être partagées\", a expliqué Miller. Amateurs de tapas mais pas toujours prêts à partager chaque bouchée, on aime le son des pintxos. Les restaurants basques sont surtout connus pour les pintxos, et dans son restaurant, Miller sert naturellement une variété. Parmi ses favoris figurent :\n*Gildas - Brochette d'anchois blancs, d'olives et de poivrons marinés (nommée d'après le rôle de Rita Hayworth en 1946).\nEgguf de caille mollet aux anchois noirs et piments piquillos.\nAubergine frite au miel et au fromage de chèvre (l'aubergine locale vient de commencer).\nChorizo ​​au feu de bois avec carottes marinées.*\n\n![https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/07/c8/a9/55.jpg](/uploads/55_3a3cb7ffba.jpg)\n\n**Au-delà des pintxos, quelles sont les caractéristiques les plus distinctives de la cuisine basque que vous ne trouverez nulle part ailleurs ?**\n\n> Beaucoup de morue salée. Dès le XVe siècle, les Basques étaient les meilleurs constructeurs de navires d'Europe et dominaient le commerce de la chasse à la baleine. Lorsque le commerce de la chasse à la baleine s'est tari, ils ont commencé à aller plus loin dans l'Atlantique Nord pour pêcher la morue, qu'ils ont salée à bord du navire comme moyen de conservation et qu'ils ont ensuite ramenée chez eux. Ainsi, même si la morue n'est pas présente dans les eaux autour de l'Espagne, c'est le poisson le plus couramment utilisé au Pays basque (bien que presque toujours séché). Ils utilisent plus de Foie Gras que d'autres régions d'Espagne.\n\n**Miller sert beaucoup de plats aux œufs à Huertas, alors je me suis demandé aussi quelle était l'importance des œufs dans la cuisine basque.**\n\n> [Au Pays basque] on se régale d'œufs à toute heure de la journée dans toute l'Espagne... Les œufs sont souvent la toile de beaux fruits de mer, produits frais ou charcuterie, comme les champignons sauvages, les asperges locales, le jambon...\n\n**J'ai demandé ce qui l'avait amené dans le nord de l'Espagne en premier lieu et ce qui l'avait attiré vers la cuisine.**\n\n> Il y a dix ans, lorsque j'ai grandi dans la cuisine, l'Espagne était à l'avant-garde pour influencer les techniques de cuisson modernes. C'est donc en grande partie ce qui m'a attiré à étudier à l'étranger à Madrid (ainsi qu'à perfectionner mon espagnol, ce qui est utile dans les cuisines de New York), ainsi qu'à ne pas trop connaître la cuisine espagnole et à avoir hâte d'apprendre quelque chose de nouveau. Quand en Espagne, j'ai appris à apprécier non pas la cuisine moderne, mais à quel point les bars à pintxo et à tapas à l'ancienne étaient formidables, à quel point ils étaient amusants à dîner et j'ai senti que nous n'avions pas beaucoup de représentation pour cette expérience à New York. Étant originaire de New York, je pense que nous devrions avoir le meilleur de tout ce qui est disponible ici et que nous voulions apporter plus de bonne cuisine espagnole dans notre ville.\n\nLa nourriture et la culture du nord de l'Espagne se traduisent mieux que celles du sud de l'Espagne à New York.

Oui, il existe de nombreux restaurants cinq étoiles pour lesquels il vaut la peine de réserver un voyage entier, mais il est tout aussi important de savourer des friandises classiques du monde entier.\n\n## Paella à Valence, Espagne\n\n![5b9eeba22100003000c61e59_9098d9fb0a.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba22100003000c61e59_9098d9fb0a_176b2163c1.jpeg)\n\nC'est ce plat classique à base de riz qui vient d'abord à l'esprit lorsque l'on pense à la gastronomie espagnole. Pour le meilleur, rendez-vous à la source : Valence. Et n'oubliez pas de gratter le fond de la casserole pour des bouchées paradisiaques de riz croquant ou de socarrat : l'arroz le plus savoureux qui ait jamais atterri sur votre palais.\n\n## Nasi Lemak en Malaisie\n\n![5b9eeba22400005100542e38_cf4839f0ad.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba22400005100542e38_cf4839f0ad_84f89b8451.jpeg)\n\nLe plat national de la Malaisie, le nasi lemak est un mélange de riz parfumé au lait de coco, servi avec une sauce sambal, des anchois croustillants frits, des cacahuètes grillées et du concombre et cuit avec des feuilles de pin à vis (pandan). Disponible à presque tous les coins de rue, ce classique très apprécié frappe toutes les notes.\n\n## Pintxos à Saint-Sébastien, Espagne\n\n![5b9eeba82200005600da3822_01759bd55b.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba82200005600da3822_01759bd55b_b46108e1aa.jpeg)\n\nParmi les villes les mieux classées pour les restaurants étoilés Michelin, Saint-Sébastien propose des pintxos (l'équivalent de petites tapas) avec des versions ultra créatives des classiques et au-delà. La haute cuisine espagnole brille dans ce paradis culinaire de la côte basque.\n\n## Pastel de Nata à Lisbonne\n\n![5b9eeba53c00005b000abbf4_be4ab6d075.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba53c00005b000abbf4_be4ab6d075_e909882796.jpeg)\n\nLa pâtisserie portugaise la plus emblématique, le [pastel de nata](http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20111107-a-bit-of-history-in-every-sweet-bite) est une sublime tarte à la crème avec des notes de citron, de cannelle et de vanille. Bonté beurrée au milieu, douceur croquante sur le dessus, qu'est-ce qu'il ne faut pas aimer ?\n\n## Mole à Puebla, Mexique\n\n![5b9eeba62100003100c61e5b_d99dbc2910.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba62100003100c61e5b_d99dbc2910_75979ebd04.jpeg)\n\nLa taupe, une spécialité de la ville mexicaine de Puebla, est un travail d'amour. La combinaison épicée-douce de cette sauce riche et chocolatée nécessite une préparation ardue et contient des ingrédients tels que des piments ancho, des épices comme l'anis et la coriandre, des graines de sésame, des amandes, des arachides, du pain rassis, de la cassonade, des raisins secs, du chocolat et des bananes plantains mûres. . Le plat culminant est digne des dieux.\n\n## Hot Pot du Sichuan en Chine\n\n![5b9eeba32500003500370d46_7d51fc80cd.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba32500003500370d46_7d51fc80cd_783924b96a.jpeg)\n\nCe n'est pas pour les âmes sensibles. Mais si vous êtes un amoureux extrême des épices, vous accueillerez les larmes qui jaillissent du lien parfait de douleur et de plaisir de la fondue.\n\n## Tajine au Maroc\n\n![5b9eeba93c000032000abbf6_12bb2e5346.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba93c000032000abbf6_12bb2e5346_9e0dac4fca.jpeg)\n\nCe ragoût salé cuit lentement, généralement composé de tranches de viande, de volaille ou de poisson et de beaucoup d'herbes et d'épices, est une véritable cuisine de l'âme marocaine. Cuit pendant des heures dans une marmite en terre cuite à couvercle conique (appelée tajine), ce plat irrésistible est servi avec du couscous ou du pain et se retrouve partout au Maroc.",

                "content": "Partout dans le monde, il existe de nombreuses différences culturelles qui définissent chaque pays. En tant que voyageur, il est important de vous renseigner sur ce que vous devriez et ne devriez pas faire lorsque vous visitez un nouveau lieu.\n\nEt puisque la nourriture est une si grande partie du voyage, il est important d'apprendre l'étiquette à manger de chaque nation. Il diffère grandement d'un endroit à l'autre. Par exemple, dans de nombreuses régions de Chine, il est considéré comme un compliment de [roter après un repas](https://www.buzzfeed.com/adamellis/surprising-food-etiquette-rules-from-around-the-world) ― un signe que vous avez bien mangé ― alors qu'aux États-Unis, ce même acte vous attirera un sérieux œil de côté.\n\nUn moyen facile de commettre un faux pas en mangeant à l'étranger est d'utiliser votre assiette ― devez-vous l'essuyer ou laisser de la nourriture ? Tout dépend de l'endroit où vous vous trouvez.\n\nVoici quatre nations où ce que vous faites avec votre assiette compte. Étudiez avant de faire un autre grand voyage.\n\n## Inde\n\nEn Inde, vous [devriez tout finir](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/international-food-customs-8-weird-food-etiquette-trends-from-around-the-world-thrillist- nation) qui est dans votre assiette car elle est [considérée comme un respect pour la nourriture servie](http://www.culturewavesglobal.com/india-etiquette-), et la nourriture en Inde est considérée comme sacrée. En Inde du Sud, où la nourriture peut être servie sur une feuille de bananier, il est poli de replier votre feuille par le haut et non par le bas, car [cela indique que vous n'étiez pas satisfait](http://www.cntraveler.com /stories/2007-10-17/etiquette-101-india).\n\n## Japon\n\nIl en va de même pour la finition de votre assiette au Japon. Les Japonais trouvent [impoli de laisser de la nourriture dans votre assiette](http://www.japan-talk.com/jt/new/in-Japan-you-need-to-finish-your-plate), que ce soit à la maison ou au restaurant. Il est lié à l'un des concepts fondamentaux de la culture japonaise, [mottainai](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/avoiding-waste-with-the-japanese-concept-of-'mottainai '/6722720), qui est un sentiment de regret d'avoir gaspillé quelque chose.\n\n## Chine\n\nEn Chine, cependant, laisser une assiette vide est un [signe à l'hôte que vous avez encore faim](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/international-food-customs-8-weird-food-étiquette-tendances-de-dans-le-monde-thrillist-nation). Si vous ne voulez pas manger plus de nourriture, envisagez de laisser un peu de côté pour informer l'hôte [vous en avez assez](http://www.healthytravelblog.com/2012/08/10/travel-etiquette-part- 3-manger-sans-s'embarrasser/).\n\n\n## Éthiopie\n\nLes Éthiopiens ne se soucient même pas des assiettes. Les plaques individuelles [sont considérées comme du gaspillage](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/asia/travel-tips-and-articles/76513). Les gens partagent leurs repas sur [une grande assiette commune](http://www.foodbycountry.com/Algeria-to-France/Ethiopia.html), et mangent généralement avec leurs mains en utilisant l'injera ― un type de pain plat ― pour choisir jusqu'à la nourriture. Alors, ne pensez même pas à demander votre propre assiette.",

Non, le premier hamburger au monde vient de Chine.\n\n## Attendez quoi ?\n\nSi vous vous grattez la tête en ce moment, vous n'êtes pas seul. Mais les hamburgers chinois sont bien réels et ils sont certainement antérieurs aux [hamburgers que nous appelons les nôtres](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-16-essential-regional_b_5682151) aux États-Unis Connu sous le nom de rou jia mo, qui se traduit à « hamburger à la viande » ou « sandwich à la viande », ils consistent en de la viande hachée à l'intérieur d'un petit pain de type pita, et ils existent depuis la dynastie Qin, d'environ 221 avant JC à 207 avant JC. Malgré les différences entre cette cuisine de rue chinoise et nos [burgers](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/perfect-way-to-eat-burger_n_4704188) à l'américaine, le rou jia mo \"[a été appelé le premier hamburger au monde](http://www.marcussamuelsson.com/news/street-food-rou-jia-mo-from-china)\".\n\nLe rou jia mo est originaire de la province chinoise du Shaanxi et est maintenant consommé dans tout le pays. Il est généralement préparé et mangé dans la rue. La pâte pour le petit pain, ou mo, se compose d'un simple mélange de farine de blé, d'eau et peut-être de levure. Bien sûr, les recettes peuvent varier, mais cette équation de base en fait un oreiller moelleux et subtil pour une délicieuse garniture. Alors que le mo est [traditionnellement cuit dans un four d'argile] (https://www.starchefs.com/cook/savory/technique/rou-jia-mo-chinese-hamburger), aujourd'hui, il est souvent frit dans une poêle. Ils peuvent ressembler un peu à [des petits pains ou des baos cuits à la vapeur chinois](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bao-facts_n_5000963), mais la pâte pour ceux-ci est, bien sûr, cuite à la vapeur, pas cuite ni frite.\n\n![https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f59304_eda97f6eaaad4c96a80de0d235813138~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_360,h_240,al_c,q_90/f59304_eda97f6eaaad4c96a80de0d235813138~mv680ea.webp/f](5996a28eaa2832897f6eaaad4c96a80de0d235813138~mv6.\n\n\nLa garniture à base de viande peut être composée de porc, de bœuf, d'agneau ou de poulet haché qui a été mijoté avec une variété d'épices, comme le gingembre, les clous de girofle, la coriandre et l'anis étoilé. Vous pouvez également trouver des herbes comme la coriandre ou des légumes verts comme la laitue pour garnir le sandwich.\n\nSi vous n'avez jamais mangé de hamburger chinois, c'est le moment idéal pour en essayer un.

        "content": "The world's first hamburger doesn't come from where you think it comes from. It wasn't invented in the United States, and it didn't originate in Germany. No, the world's first hamburger comes from China.\n\n## Wait what?\n\nIf you're scratching your head right now, you're not alone. But Chinese hamburgers are very real and they definitely predate the [hamburgers we call our own](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-16-essential-regional_b_5682151) in the U.S. Known as rou jia mo, which translates to \"meat burger\" or \"meat sandwich,\" they consist of chopped meat inside a pita-like bun, and they've been around since the Qin dynasty, from about 221 BC to 207 BC. Despite the differences between this Chinese street food and our American-style [burgers](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/perfect-way-to-eat-burger_n_4704188), the rou jia mo \"[has been called the world's first hamburger](http://www.marcussamuelsson.com/news/street-food-rou-jia-mo-from-china)\".\n\nThe rou jia mo originated in the Shaanxi Province of China, and is now eaten all over the country. It's typically prepared and eaten on the street. The dough for the bun, or mo, consists of a simple mixture of wheat flour, water and maybe yeast. Of course recipes may vary, but this basic equation makes for a chewy and subtle pillow for the delicious filling. While the mo is [traditionally baked in a clay oven](https://www.starchefs.com/cook/savory/technique/rou-jia-mo-chinese-hamburger), today it's often fried in a pan. They may look a little like [Chinese steamed buns or baos](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bao-facts_n_5000963), but the dough for those are, of course, steamed, not baked or fried.\n\n![https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f59304_eda97f6eaaad4c96a80de0d235813138~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_360,h_240,al_c,q_90/f59304_eda97f6eaaad4c96a80de0d235813138~mv2.webp](/uploads/f59304_eda97f6eaaad4c96a80de0d235813138_mv2_128aac85a3.webp)\n\n\nThe meat filling might consist of chopped pork, beef, lamb or chicken that has been stewed with a variety of spices, like ginger, cloves, coriander and star anise. You might also find herbs like cilantro or greens like lettuce garnishing the sandwich.\n\nIf you've never had a Chinese hamburger, now is as great a time as any to try one.

                "content": "Across the globe, there are many cultural differences that define each country. As a traveler, it’s important to educate yourself on what you should and shouldn’t do when visiting a new locale.\n\nAnd since food is such a big part of travel, it’s important to learn the dining etiquette of each nation. It differs greatly from place to place. For example, in many areas of China it’s considered a compliment to [burp after a meal](https://www.buzzfeed.com/adamellis/surprising-food-etiquette-rules-from-around-the-world) ― a sign that you’ve eaten well ― while stateside, that same act will get you some serious side eye.\n\nOne easy way you can commit a faux pas while eating abroad is with your plate ― should you wipe it clean or leave some food? It all depends on where you are.\n\nHere are four nations where what you do with your plate matters. Study up before you make another big trip.\n\n## India \n\nIn India, you [should finish everything](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/international-food-customs-8-weird-food-etiquette-trends-from-around-the-world-thrillist-nation) that is on your plate because it is [considered a respect for the served food](http://www.culturewavesglobal.com/india-etiquette-), and food in India is considered sacred. In South India, where food can be served on a banana leaf, it is polite to fold your leaf over from the top ― not from the bottom, because [that indicates you were not satisfied](http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2007-10-17/etiquette-101-india).\n\n## Japan\n\nThe same is true about finishing your plate in Japan. The Japanese consider it [rude to leave food on your plate](http://www.japan-talk.com/jt/new/in-Japan-you-need-to-finish-your-plate), whether at home or at a restaurant. It’s related to one of the fundamental concepts in Japanese culture, [mottainai](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/avoiding-waste-with-the-japanese-concept-of-'mottainai'/6722720), which is a feeling of regret at having wasted something.\n\n## China\n\nIn China, however, leaving behind an empty plate is a [sign to the host that you’re still hungry](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/international-food-customs-8-weird-food-etiquette-trends-from-around-the-world-thrillist-nation). If you don’t want to eat more food, consider leaving a little behind to let the host know [you have had enough](http://www.healthytravelblog.com/2012/08/10/travel-etiquette-part-3-eating-without-embarrassing-yourself/).\n\n\n## Ethiopia\n\nEthiopians don’t even bother with plates. Individual plates [are considered wasteful](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/asia/travel-tips-and-articles/76513?lpaffil=lp-affiliates). Folks share meals off of [one big communal plate](http://www.foodbycountry.com/Algeria-to-France/Ethiopia.html), and generally eat with their hands using injera ― a type of flat bread ― to pick up the food. So, don’t even think about asking for your own plate.\n",

                "content": "> There is no love sincerer than the love of food \nsaid George Bernard Shaw, and let us also add that there's arguably no better way to explore a culture than to eat voraciously while traveling. Yes, there are many five-star restaurants worth booking an entire trip for, but it's equally important to savor classic treats from across the world.\n\n## Paella in Valencia, Spain\n\n![5b9eeba22100003000c61e59_9098d9fb0a.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba22100003000c61e59_9098d9fb0a_176b2163c1.jpeg)\n\nIt’s this classic rice-based dish that first pops to mind when thinking of Spanish gastronomy. For the best there is, head to the source: Valencia. And don’t forget to scrape the bottom of the pan for heavenly bites of crunchy rice, or socarrat: the most flavorful arroz ever to land on your palate.\n\n## Nasi Lemak in Malaysia\n\n![5b9eeba22400005100542e38_cf4839f0ad.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba22400005100542e38_cf4839f0ad_84f89b8451.jpeg)\n\nMalaysia’s national dish, nasi lemak is a fragrant coconut-milk rice mixture, served with sambal sauce, fried crispy anchovies, toasted peanuts, and cucumber and cooked with screw pine (pandan) leaves. Available on almost every street corner, this much-loved classic hits all the notes.\n\n## Pintxos in San Sebastián, Spain\n\n![5b9eeba82200005600da3822_01759bd55b.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba82200005600da3822_01759bd55b_b46108e1aa.jpeg)\n\nAmong the most highly ranked cities for Michelin-starred restaurants, San Sebastián boasts pintxos (the equivalent of small tapas) with über-creative takes on classics and beyond. Spain’s haute cuisine shines in this culinary paradise on the Basque coast.\n\n## Pastel de Nata in Lisbon\n\n![5b9eeba53c00005b000abbf4_be4ab6d075.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba53c00005b000abbf4_be4ab6d075_e909882796.jpeg)\n\nThe most iconic Portuguese pastry, the [pastel de nata](http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20111107-a-bit-of-history-in-every-sweet-bite) is a sublime custard tart with hints of lemon, cinnamon, and vanilla. Buttery goodness in the middle, crunchy sweetness on top—what’s not to love?\n\n## Mole in Puebla, Mexico\n\n![5b9eeba62100003100c61e5b_d99dbc2910.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba62100003100c61e5b_d99dbc2910_75979ebd04.jpeg)\n\nMole, a specialty in the Mexican city of Puebla, is a labor of love. The spicy-sweet combination of this rich, chocolate-colored sauce takes arduous preparation and packs ingredients such as ancho chiles, spices like anise and coriander, sesame seeds, almonds, peanuts, stale bread, brown sugar, raisins, chocolate, and ripe plantains. The culminating dish is fit for the gods.\n\n## Sichuan Hot Pot in China\n\n![5b9eeba32500003500370d46_7d51fc80cd.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba32500003500370d46_7d51fc80cd_783924b96a.jpeg)\n\nThis isn’t for the faint of heart. But if you’re an extreme spice lover, you’ll welcome the tears that come from the hot pot’s perfect nexus of pain and pleasure.\n\n## Tagine in Morocco\n\n![5b9eeba93c000032000abbf6_12bb2e5346.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba93c000032000abbf6_12bb2e5346_9e0dac4fca.jpeg)\n\nThis slow-cooked savory stew, typically made with sliced meat, poultry, or fish and lots of herbs and spices, is true Moroccan soul food. Cooked for hours in a clay cooking pot with a conical lid (known as a tagine), this irresistible dish is served with couscous or bread and can be found all over Morocco.\n\n",

                "content": "Thanks to [Ferran Adrià](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-measure-the-restau_b_5475536), tapas and a fascination with all things pork -- from chorizo to chicharrones -- Spanish cuisine has been a star in the food world in recent years. But a less familiar part of Spanish cuisine is Basque -- considerably unique and different from the broader Spanish cuisine that has been exported across the globe. Basque cuisine is worth getting to know, however, and with an influx of Basque-inspired restaurants in food-forward cities like New York, it appears that this culinary tradition is gaining the foothold it deserves.\n\nBasque country lies in the North of Spain near the Bay of Biscay and in South Western France. With fertile ground for grains and vineyards in an area called Álava, and good land for livestock breeding in Vizcaya and Guipúzcoa, Basque country has a rich culinary heritage. It's no wonder then that today the region boasts [almost 40 Michelin starred restaurants](http://www.euskoguide.com/food-drink-basque-country/michelin-star-restaurants.html).\n\nI spoke to executive chef and owner of the new Basque-inspired restaurant [Huertas](http://huertasnyc.com/t) in New York City to learn more about the unique cuisine. Ten years ago, after working in some of New York's most prominent restaurants, chef Jonah Miller took off for Northern Spain to learn more. In April of this year he opened his first restaurant, dedicated to the food he studied and fell in love with.\n\n**I asked Jonah to describe some quintessential Basque dishes, and the overarching themes were salt cod and peppers.**\n\n*Salt Cod (in many forms), including:*\n- Kokotxas al Pil-Pil - Fish cheeks and throats in a \"pil-pil\" sauce, which refers to the sound made when shaking a cazuela to activate the natural gelatin in the fish cheeks.\n- Tortilla de Bacalao - A salt cod omelet.\n- Porrusalda - Potato, leek, salt cod soup.\nPiperrada - Sauteed peppers (they use lots of peppers), onions, garlic and tomato, often served with a fried egg.\nStuffed Piquillo Peppers.\nMarmitako - Tuna with potato and pepper stew.\n\n**I also asked what some quintessential Basque beverages might be.**\n\n> Sidra (cider), which is much dryer and funkier than ciders we are familiar with, and Txakoli, slightly effervescent white wine. Both are low in alcohol and highly acidic -- perfect to drink with pintxos.\n\n**So what are pintxos?**\n\n> \"Pintxos are small, composed bites that unlike tapas, aren't meant to be shared,\" explained Miller. Fans of tapas but not always down to share every bite, we like the sound of pintxos. Basque restaurants are best known for pintxos, and at his restaurant, Miller naturally serves a variety. Among his favorites are:\n*Gildas - White anchovy, olive and pickled pepper skewer (named after 1946 Rita Hayworth role).\nSoft Boiled Quail Egg with Black Anchovy and Piquillo Peppers.\nFried Eggplant with Honey and Goat Cheese (local eggplant just started).\nWood-Fired Chorizo with Pickled Carrots.*\n\n![https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/07/c8/a9/55.jpg](/uploads/55_3a3cb7ffba.jpg)\n\n**Other than Pintxos, what are more distinguishing features of Basque cuisine that you won't find anywhere else?**\n\n> Lots of salt cod. As far back at the 15th century Basques were the best ship builders in Europe and dominated the whaling trade. When the whaling trade dried up, they began going further into the north Atlantic to fish for cod, which they salted aboard the ship as a means of preservation and then brought home. So even though cod is not present in the waters around Spain, it is the fish most commonly used in the Basque country (though almost always dried). They use more Foie Gras than other areas of Spain.\n\n**Miller serves a lot of egg dishes at Huertas, so I wondered too how important eggs were in Basque cuisine.**\n\n> [In the Basque country] they enjoy eggs at all times of day throughout Spain... Eggs are often the canvas for beautiful seafood, produce or charcuterie, such as wild mushrooms, local asparagus, jamon...\n\n**I asked what brought him to Northern Spain in the first place and what drew him to the cuisine.**\n\n> Ten years ago when I was growing up working in kitchens, Spain was at the forefront of influencing modern cooking techniques. So that was largely what attracted me to studying abroad in Madrid (as well as honing my Spanish speaking, which is helpful in NYC kitchens), as well as not knowing much about Spanish cuisine and looking forward to learning something new. When in Spain, I came to appreciate not the modern cooking, but how great the old-school pintxo and tapas bars were, how fun they were to dine in and felt that we didn't have much representation for that experience in New York. Being a native New Yorker, I think we should have the best of everything available here, and wanted to bring more great Spanish food to our city.\n\nThe food and culture of the north of Spain translates better than the south of Spain to New York. For one thing, being closer to the rest of Europe, the north is more cosmopolitan and a bit more diverse. Also, the climate in the north (and accordingly produce) is not far off from that of New York.\n\n**Now I'm hungry. I asked what a typical way to start and end a Basque meal is.**\n\n> [To start,] Txakolina and simply cooked seafood. [To finish,] there are some delicious Basque vermouths, which are a bit sweet and are had after dinner or often in the afternoon (some of which we offer, as well as making our own). They do make caramels and toffees, as well as Turron, an almond nougat. All traditional ends to a meal. There are also many cakes and tarts that are traditional.\n\n**So now that I'm ready to dive head first into Basque cuisine, what would be an approachable dish to try making at home?**\n\n> Pintxos!! Go to Despana (a Spanish specialty foods store), pick up one or two cheeses, one or two cured meats, anchovies, a tin of seafood; the greenmarket for some seasonal produce and local honey; get some good bread, toothpicks, and start trying out different combinations. Try this cheese with honey and shaved carrots, those anchovies with tomato on toast.\n",

Non, le premier hamburger au monde vient de Chine.\n\n## Attendez quoi ?\n\nSi vous vous grattez la tête en ce moment, vous n'êtes pas seul. Mais les hamburgers chinois sont bien réels et ils sont certainement antérieurs aux [hamburgers que nous appelons les nôtres](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-16-essential-regional_b_5682151) aux États-Unis Connu sous le nom de rou jia mo, qui se traduit à « hamburger à la viande » ou « sandwich à la viande », ils consistent en de la viande hachée à l'intérieur d'un petit pain de type pita, et ils existent depuis la dynastie Qin, d'environ 221 avant JC à 207 avant JC. Malgré les différences entre cette cuisine de rue chinoise et nos [burgers](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/perfect-way-to-eat-burger_n_4704188) à l'américaine, le rou jia mo \"[a été appelé le premier hamburger au monde](http://www.marcussamuelsson.com/news/street-food-rou-jia-mo-from-china)\".\n\nLe rou jia mo est originaire de la province chinoise du Shaanxi et est maintenant consommé dans tout le pays. Il est généralement préparé et mangé dans la rue. La pâte pour le petit pain, ou mo, se compose d'un simple mélange de farine de blé, d'eau et peut-être de levure. Bien sûr, les recettes peuvent varier, mais cette équation de base en fait un oreiller moelleux et subtil pour une délicieuse garniture. Alors que le mo est [traditionnellement cuit dans un four d'argile] (https://www.starchefs.com/cook/savory/technique/rou-jia-mo-chinese-hamburger), aujourd'hui, il est souvent frit dans une poêle. Ils peuvent ressembler un peu à [des petits pains ou des baos cuits à la vapeur chinois](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bao-facts_n_5000963), mais la pâte pour ceux-ci est, bien sûr, cuite à la vapeur, pas cuite ni frite.\n\n![https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f59304_eda97f6eaaad4c96a80de0d235813138~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_360,h_240,al_c,q_90/f59304_eda97f6eaaad4c96a80de0d235813138~mv680ea.webp/f](5996a28eaa2832897f6eaaad4c96a80de0d235813138~mv6.\n\n\nLa garniture à base de viande peut être composée de porc, de bœuf, d'agneau ou de poulet haché qui a été mijoté avec une variété d'épices, comme le gingembre, les clous de girofle, la coriandre et l'anis étoilé. Vous pouvez également trouver des herbes comme la coriandre ou des légumes verts comme la laitue pour garnir le sandwich.\n\nSi vous n'avez jamais mangé de hamburger chinois, c'est le moment idéal pour en essayer un.

                "content": "> Il n'y a pas d'amour plus sincère que l'amour de la nourriture\na déclaré George Bernard Shaw, et ajoutons également qu'il n'y a sans doute pas de meilleure façon d'explorer une culture que de manger avec voracité en voyageant. Oui, il existe de nombreux restaurants cinq étoiles pour lesquels il vaut la peine de réserver un voyage entier, mais il est tout aussi important de savourer des friandises classiques du monde entier.\n\n## Paella à Valence, Espagne\n\n![5b9eeba22100003000c61e59_9098d9fb0a.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba22100003000c61e59_9098d9fb0a_176b2163c1.jpeg)\n\nC'est ce plat classique à base de riz qui vient d'abord à l'esprit lorsque l'on pense à la gastronomie espagnole. Pour le meilleur, rendez-vous à la source : Valence. Et n'oubliez pas de gratter le fond de la casserole pour des bouchées paradisiaques de riz croquant ou de socarrat : l'arroz le plus savoureux qui ait jamais atterri sur votre palais.\n\n## Nasi Lemak en Malaisie\n\n![5b9eeba22400005100542e38_cf4839f0ad.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba22400005100542e38_cf4839f0ad_84f89b8451.jpeg)\n\nLe plat national de la Malaisie, le nasi lemak est un mélange de riz parfumé au lait de coco, servi avec une sauce sambal, des anchois croustillants frits, des cacahuètes grillées et du concombre et cuit avec des feuilles de pin à vis (pandan). Disponible à presque tous les coins de rue, ce classique très apprécié frappe toutes les notes.\n\n## Pintxos à Saint-Sébastien, Espagne\n\n![5b9eeba82200005600da3822_01759bd55b.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba82200005600da3822_01759bd55b_b46108e1aa.jpeg)\n\nParmi les villes les mieux classées pour les restaurants étoilés Michelin, Saint-Sébastien propose des pintxos (l'équivalent de petites tapas) avec des versions ultra créatives des classiques et au-delà. La haute cuisine espagnole brille dans ce paradis culinaire de la côte basque.\n\n## Pastel de Nata à Lisbonne\n\n![5b9eeba53c00005b000abbf4_be4ab6d075.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba53c00005b000abbf4_be4ab6d075_e909882796.jpeg)\n\nLa pâtisserie portugaise la plus emblématique, le [pastel de nata](http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20111107-a-bit-of-history-in-every-sweet-bite) est une sublime tarte à la crème avec des notes de citron, de cannelle et de vanille. Bonté beurrée au milieu, douceur croquante sur le dessus, qu'est-ce qu'il ne faut pas aimer ?\n\n## Mole à Puebla, Mexique\n\n![5b9eeba62100003100c61e5b_d99dbc2910.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba62100003100c61e5b_d99dbc2910_75979ebd04.jpeg)\n\nLa taupe, une spécialité de la ville mexicaine de Puebla, est un travail d'amour. La combinaison épicée-douce de cette sauce riche et chocolatée nécessite une préparation ardue et contient des ingrédients tels que des piments ancho, des épices comme l'anis et la coriandre, des graines de sésame, des amandes, des arachides, du pain rassis, de la cassonade, des raisins secs, du chocolat et des bananes plantains mûres. . Le plat culminant est digne des dieux.\n\n## Hot Pot du Sichuan en Chine\n\n![5b9eeba32500003500370d46_7d51fc80cd.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba32500003500370d46_7d51fc80cd_783924b96a.jpeg)\n\nCe n'est pas pour les âmes sensibles. Mais si vous êtes un amoureux extrême des épices, vous accueillerez les larmes qui jaillissent du lien parfait de douleur et de plaisir de la fondue.\n\n## Tajine au Maroc\n\n![5b9eeba93c000032000abbf6_12bb2e5346.jpeg](/uploads/5b9eeba93c000032000abbf6_12bb2e5346_9e0dac4fca.jpeg)\n\nCe ragoût salé cuit lentement, généralement composé de tranches de viande, de volaille ou de poisson et de beaucoup d'herbes et d'épices, est une véritable cuisine de l'âme marocaine. Cuit pendant des heures dans une marmite en terre cuite à couvercle conique (appelée tajine), ce plat irrésistible est servi avec du couscous ou du pain et se retrouve partout au Maroc.",

                "content": "Partout dans le monde, il existe de nombreuses différences culturelles qui définissent chaque pays. En tant que voyageur, il est important de vous renseigner sur ce que vous devriez et ne devriez pas faire lorsque vous visitez un nouveau lieu.\n\nEt puisque la nourriture est une si grande partie du voyage, il est important d'apprendre l'étiquette à manger de chaque nation. Il diffère grandement d'un endroit à l'autre. Par exemple, dans de nombreuses régions de Chine, il est considéré comme un compliment de [roter après un repas](https://www.buzzfeed.com/adamellis/surprising-food-etiquette-rules-from-around-the-world) ― un signe que vous avez bien mangé ― alors qu'aux États-Unis, ce même acte vous attirera un sérieux œil de côté.\n\nUn moyen facile de commettre un faux pas en mangeant à l'étranger est d'utiliser votre assiette ― devez-vous l'essuyer ou laisser de la nourriture ? Tout dépend de l'endroit où vous vous trouvez.\n\nVoici quatre nations où ce que vous faites avec votre assiette compte. Étudiez avant de faire un autre grand voyage.\n\n## Inde\n\nEn Inde, vous [devriez tout finir](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/international-food-customs-8-weird-food-etiquette-trends-from-around-the-world-thrillist- nation) qui est dans votre assiette car elle est [considérée comme un respect pour la nourriture servie](http://www.culturewavesglobal.com/india-etiquette-), et la nourriture en Inde est considérée comme sacrée. En Inde du Sud, où la nourriture peut être servie sur une feuille de bananier, il est poli de replier votre feuille par le haut et non par le bas, car [cela indique que vous n'étiez pas satisfait](http://www.cntraveler.com /stories/2007-10-17/etiquette-101-india).\n\n## Japon\n\nIl en va de même pour la finition de votre assiette au Japon. Les Japonais trouvent [impoli de laisser de la nourriture dans votre assiette](http://www.japan-talk.com/jt/new/in-Japan-you-need-to-finish-your-plate), que ce soit à la maison ou au restaurant. Il est lié à l'un des concepts fondamentaux de la culture japonaise, [mottainai](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/avoiding-waste-with-the-japanese-concept-of-'mottainai '/6722720), qui est un sentiment de regret d'avoir gaspillé quelque chose.\n\n## Chine\n\nEn Chine, cependant, laisser une assiette vide est un [signe à l'hôte que vous avez encore faim](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/international-food-customs-8-weird-food-étiquette-tendances-de-dans-le-monde-thrillist-nation). Si vous ne voulez pas manger plus de nourriture, envisagez de laisser un peu de côté pour informer l'hôte [vous en avez assez](http://www.healthytravelblog.com/2012/08/10/travel-etiquette-part- 3-manger-sans-s'embarrasser/).\n\n\n## Éthiopie\n\nLes Éthiopiens ne se soucient même pas des assiettes. Les plaques individuelles [sont considérées comme du gaspillage](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/asia/travel-tips-and-articles/76513). Les gens partagent leurs repas sur [une grande assiette commune](http://www.foodbycountry.com/Algeria-to-France/Ethiopia.html), et mangent généralement avec leurs mains en utilisant l'injera ― un type de pain plat ― pour choisir jusqu'à la nourriture. Alors, ne pensez même pas à demander votre propre assiette.",

Mais une partie moins familière de la cuisine espagnole est basque - considérablement unique et différente de la cuisine espagnole plus large qui a été exportée à travers le monde. Cependant, la cuisine basque vaut la peine d'être connue, et avec un afflux de restaurants d'inspiration basque dans des villes gourmandes comme New York, il semble que cette tradition culinaire prenne la place qu'elle mérite.\n\nLe Pays Basque se situe au nord de l'Espagne près du golfe de Gascogne et dans le sud-ouest de la France. Avec un sol fertile pour les céréales et les vignobles dans une région appelée Álava, et de bonnes terres pour l'élevage en Biscaye et Guipúzcoa, le pays basque possède un riche patrimoine culinaire. Il n'est donc pas étonnant qu'aujourd'hui la région compte [presque 40 restaurants étoilés Michelin] (http://www.euskoguide.com/food-drink-basque-country/michelin-star-restaurants.html).\n\nJ'ai parlé au chef exécutif et propriétaire du nouveau restaurant d'inspiration basque [Huertas] (http://huertasnyc.com/t) à New York pour en savoir plus sur la cuisine unique. Il y a dix ans, après avoir travaillé dans certains des restaurants les plus en vue de New York, le chef Jonah Miller s'est envolé pour le nord de l'Espagne pour en savoir plus. En avril de cette année, il a ouvert son premier restaurant, dédié à la nourriture qu'il a étudiée et dont il est tombé amoureux.\n\n**J'ai demandé à Jonah de décrire certains plats basques par excellence, et les thèmes dominants étaient la morue salée et les poivrons.**\n\n* Morue salée (sous de nombreuses formes), y compris :*\n- Kokotxas al Pil-Pil - Joues et gorges de poisson dans une sauce \"pil-pil\", qui fait référence au son émis en secouant une cazuela pour activer la gélatine naturelle dans les joues de poisson.\n- Tortilla de Bacalao - Une omelette à la morue salée.\n- Porrusalda - Soupe de pommes de terre, poireaux, morue salée.\nPiperrada - Poivrons sautés (ils utilisent beaucoup de poivrons), oignons, ail et tomate, souvent servis avec un œuf au plat.\nPoivrons de Piquillo farcis.\nMarmitako - Thon avec ragoût de pommes de terre et poivrons.\n\n**J'ai également demandé quelles pourraient être les boissons basques par excellence.**\n\n> Sidra (cidre), beaucoup plus sec et funky que les cidres que nous connaissons, et Txakoli, vin blanc légèrement effervescent. Les deux sont faibles en alcool et très acides - parfaits à boire avec des pintxos.\n\n**Alors, que sont les pintxos ?**\n\n> \"Les pintxos sont de petites bouchées composées qui, contrairement aux tapas, ne sont pas destinées à être partagées\", a expliqué Miller. Amateurs de tapas mais pas toujours prêts à partager chaque bouchée, on aime le son des pintxos. Les restaurants basques sont surtout connus pour les pintxos, et dans son restaurant, Miller sert naturellement une variété. Parmi ses favoris figurent :\n*Gildas - Brochette d'anchois blancs, d'olives et de poivrons marinés (nommée d'après le rôle de Rita Hayworth en 1946).\nEgguf de caille mollet aux anchois noirs et piments piquillos.\nAubergine frite au miel et au fromage de chèvre (l'aubergine locale vient de commencer).\nChorizo ​​au feu de bois avec carottes marinées.*\n\n![https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/07/c8/a9/55.jpg](/uploads/55_3a3cb7ffba.jpg)\n\n**Au-delà des pintxos, quelles sont les caractéristiques les plus distinctives de la cuisine basque que vous ne trouverez nulle part ailleurs ?**\n\n> Beaucoup de morue salée. Dès le XVe siècle, les Basques étaient les meilleurs constructeurs de navires d'Europe et dominaient le commerce de la chasse à la baleine. Lorsque le commerce de la chasse à la baleine s'est tari, ils ont commencé à aller plus loin dans l'Atlantique Nord pour pêcher la morue, qu'ils ont salée à bord du navire comme moyen de conservation et qu'ils ont ensuite ramenée chez eux. Ainsi, même si la morue n'est pas présente dans les eaux autour de l'Espagne, c'est le poisson le plus couramment utilisé au Pays basque (bien que presque toujours séché). Ils utilisent plus de Foie Gras que d'autres régions d'Espagne.\n\n**Miller sert beaucoup de plats aux œufs à Huertas, alors je me suis demandé aussi quelle était l'importance des œufs dans la cuisine basque.**\n\n> [Au Pays basque] on se régale d'œufs à toute heure de la journée dans toute l'Espagne... Les œufs sont souvent la toile de beaux fruits de mer, produits frais ou charcuterie, comme les champignons sauvages, les asperges locales, le jambon...\n\n**J'ai demandé ce qui l'avait amené dans le nord de l'Espagne en premier lieu et ce qui l'avait attiré vers la cuisine.**\n\n> Il y a dix ans, lorsque j'ai grandi dans la cuisine, l'Espagne était à l'avant-garde pour influencer les techniques de cuisson modernes. C'est donc en grande partie ce qui m'a attiré à étudier à l'étranger à Madrid (ainsi qu'à perfectionner mon espagnol, ce qui est utile dans les cuisines de New York), ainsi qu'à ne pas trop connaître la cuisine espagnole et à avoir hâte d'apprendre quelque chose de nouveau. Quand en Espagne, j'ai appris à apprécier non pas la cuisine moderne, mais à quel point les bars à pintxo et à tapas à l'ancienne étaient formidables, à quel point ils étaient amusants à dîner et j'ai senti que nous n'avions pas beaucoup de représentation pour cette expérience à New York. Étant originaire de New York, je pense que nous devrions avoir le meilleur de tout ce qui est disponible ici et que nous voulions apporter plus de bonne cuisine espagnole dans notre ville.\n\nLa nourriture et la culture du nord de l'Espagne se traduisent mieux que celles du sud de l'Espagne à New York.
